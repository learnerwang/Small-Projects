 Research Status 
 My research interests are Web information retrieval (IR) and user behavior analysis. In most IR tasks, user queries are always short and fuzzy, while the known document space is huge with complex information. Therefore, the main problem in IR lies in the mismatch of information representations between the user query space and the known document space. This is what my work is abased on. My research contributions are: 
In the research of IR approaches to better document modeling, we studied the nature of novelty information, focusing on how to find new and non-redundant information to a user's request. We have proposed a document refinement approach based on query expansion, and a selective pooling-based document matching strategy. For document representation, an object-based document description is proposed. We also propose a unified generation model for topic relevance and opinion sentiments. The work has been published on important international journals and conferences, such as Journal of IR, SIGIR, CIKM, etc. One patent has been granted. 
We are also leveraging wisdom of crowds and studying user behaviors based on large-scale user log data. Our proposed web page quality estimation and anti-spam algorithms are able to solve the robustness and timeliness problem of state-of-art technologies. Our automatic search engine performance evaluation approach handles the problems of the time and labor cost by human annotation. Currently, the automatic evaluation service for six main Chinese commercial search engines are daily provided online. We also study to understand user intentions, build user browsing graphs, and predict users' satisfaction level. Furthermore, we analyze the reliability of user behavior, and propose a model of user reliability and click relevance, which estimates the quality using both hot queries/clicks and long tail queries/clicks. This study has been published on important international journals and conferences, such as JASIST, WWW, WSDM, CIKM, etc. 8 patents have been filed, four of which were granted. Our proposed approaches have also been deployed on Sogou online search engine via  Tsinghua-Sohu  Joint Research Lab, and demonstrated good results and high potential in real web applications.
