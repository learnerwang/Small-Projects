 Areas of Research Interests/ Research Projects 
 Data Mining, Machine Learning 
 Autonomic Computing

 National 863 High-Tech Program: Evaluation Techniques for High-Performance Fault-Torrent Systems (2008-2010). 
 Research Status 
 My research group addresses fundamental problems in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning of high-dimensional data, such as documents, biological data, and scientific data. I am also interested in developing novel data mining methods, and applying them to autonomic computing problems, such as monitoring system performance, predicting and diagnosing system failures, and building spatial and temporal system performance models. 
 My research on unsupervised and semi-supervised learning of high-dimensional data contributes in two ways: 1) analyzing the relationship between clustering performances and criterion functions; 2) proposing a semi-supervised, topic-driven clustering algorithm to incorporate high-level prior knowledge and users' cognitive models on the datasets in clustering. My research on autonomic computing results in two systems: 1) a monitoring system based on spatial and temporal correlation for distributed systems; 2) a HMM- and HSMM-based hard disk failure prediction system.
