 Research Status 
 I have been engaged in the basic research and application promotion of computing systems in recent years, including areas of distributed systems and network computing. I'm particularly interested in transparent computing systems and devices based on the ubiquitous/pervasive concept. Currently, I am in charge of one project funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China and one by National 863 High-Tech Program. For the past years, I have been involved as a main contributor in the completion of more than 10 projects, including national research programs (863, 973, etc.), national or international joint projects, and industrialization programs. I have devoted myself to the research and implementation of transparent computing for several years. Signification social and economic benefits have been achieved in promoting the application of transparent computing systems in China. I have won National Award for Technological Invention and four provincial/ministerial awards. I have published over 40 technical papers and 1 academic monograph. In 2007, I received the IEEE Best Paper Award at IEEE AINA 2007 conference. I hold 6 Chinese and 1 U. S. patents. 
The concept of transparent computing was put forward by Prof. Yaoxue Zhang, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Based on that, my work in the theory and realization of transparent computing aims at solving the problems of traditional computing paradigms, such as continuous upgrading, complicated maintenance and management operations, high cost, and low security. I have produced several research outputs, including a remote boot method for multiple operating systems, a system software sharing and isolation mechanism among multi-machines, and multi-level user identification and access control. Meanwhile, I have led the design and development of Meta OS, a software platform of transparent computing systems. Our transparent computing systems, which are based on the above platform and have been successfully industrialized, are able to satisfy users' needs in China, such as low cost, high efficiency, high manageability, and high security. To summarize our 10 years' experiences in this area, Prof. Yaoxue Zhang and I collaboratively wrote an academic monograph, titled  Transparent Computing: Concepts, Architecture, and Implementation . This book was published by Cengage Learning in 2009. 
Experts at Carnegie Mellon University commented on our transparent computing system that it is a  very interesting innovation and may have significant implications for the design of future distributed systems . The technology of transparent computing has been successfully transferred to Lenovo (Beijing) Co., Ltd. and other well-known Chinese companies for industrial production. Their products have been adopted in various areas such as military, education, government, and business, benefiting the many organizations and individual users.
