 Research Status 
 My research interest is parallel computing. In particular, I try to solve the problems of programming wall, memory wall, debugging wall and availability wall we face in parallel computing. In the recent two years, I have also been interested in mobile computing. My research in mobile computing aims at using cloud to manage operating systems, applications and data of mobile devices, and address the reliability, power and network bandwidth issues of current mobile computing platforms. 
 My research team has proposed a highly effective and low-cost technique which can be used to predict the performance of a high-performance computer early in the design phase. This technique is an elegant combination of compiler techniques, deterministic replay techniques and a high-fidelity trace-driven MPI simulator. In the area of compiler techniques, we investigate a new generation of iterative compilation techniques by employing feedbacks of production applications provided by hardware performance counters. Our idea significantly reduces the overhead of traditional feedback-based optimization approaches. 
 We have extensive collaborations with major industry companies on the above research areas. One of our research results, the MPI process placement optimization techniques, has filed a U.S. patent by Intel.
