 Research Status 
 My working areas include operating systems, embedded systems, pervasive computing, and parallel computing. 
 Recently, I have been focusing on the OS VMM optimization for multi-core computer architecture and high performance I/O devices. My students and I have published some papers in this field. I am also interested in the interoperation among devices in a pervasive computing environment. 
 For the purpose of better and easier researching OS, I have developed an open source project named SkyEye, which is a hardware simulator. SkyEye has been used in universities, companies and some research groups.
