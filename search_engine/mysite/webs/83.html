 Research Status 
 I have been studying quantum information, especially weird phenomenon and new applications of quantum entanglement since 2002. By now, several important contributions have been made to the following fundamental topics in quantum information: quantum state/operation discrimination, zero-error communication with noisy quantum channels, and entanglement transformation theory. I have published more than 36 papers on prominent international journals and presented 4 papers at international conferences. These efforts have been widely recognized and have stimulated a lot research interests. My most significant contributions are as follows: 
 1. Characterization of the distinguishability of quantum operations: One fundamental problem in quantum information is to characterize the perfect distinguishability of quantum operations, which consist of all physically realizable operations allowed by quantum mechanics. Many other important information processing tasks can be treated as special cases of this problem. Since the seminal work proposed by Childs, Preskill, and Renes in 1999, this problem has been studied extensively and many interesting partial results have been reported. However, it remains open whether two general quantum operations are perfectly distinguishable. I, in collaboration with Prof. Yuan Feng and Prof. Mingsheng Ying, have made three key contributions to the above topic. Most notably, we have obtained a feasible, necessary and sufficient condition for the perfect distinguishability of quantum operations, and thus finally solved the above long-standing open problem. The referees of Physical Review Letters remarked that (our paper)  is a solid piece of research, which significantly advances our knowledge and understanding of quantum processes and operations . 
 2. Quantum Zero-Error Information Theory: Together with Yaoyun Shi (Univ. of Michigan), I have discovered a rather surprising difference between quantum and classical channels in zero-error communication scenario. There are quantum channels that cannot perfectly transmit classical information through a single use, but through two uses. One of referees of Physical Review Letters said that (our result)  is a really nice piece of quantum information science . Later, I have further refined this discovery by exhibiting various super-activation effects. These efforts have greatly developed the quantum zero-error information theory, and have stimulated broad research interests of many distinguished researchers.
