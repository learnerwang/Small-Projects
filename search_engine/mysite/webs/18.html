 Research Status 
 From 1996 to 1998, I was a Staff Research Fellow at UCLA, where I conducted cutting-edge research on multimedia coding and communications. Many of my inventions were later adopted by international standards such as H.263, MPEG and H.264. After UCLA, I served as the Principal Scientist of PacketVideo Corp., the CTO of Morphbius Technology Inc., the Director of Video Codec Technologies of Mobilygen Corp, the Senior Director of Technology of Ortiva Wireless and consulted for Stretch Inc. and Ocarina Networks. Since 2009, I have held a Professorship at the Department of Computer Science and Technology of Tsinghua University, where I am also the Director of the Research Center of the Internet of Things. I have also been a Visiting Fellow at Princeton University since 2010. 
 I am a world-renowned expert in multimedia communication over hostile networks, video coding and communications. I have authored many widely referenced papers in related fields. Products deploying technologies that I developed are currently widely used worldwide. I hold over 30 patents with numerous others pending. I am Senior Member of IEEE, and Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions CSVT.
