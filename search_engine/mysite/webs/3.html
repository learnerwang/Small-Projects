 Research Status 
 The research areas of my group cover 1) robotics (UAVs, study of China's development strategies of robot techniques, service and personal robot, and BCI-based mind control of humanoid robot), 2) wireless sensor networks (WSN hardware design, ZigBee protocol network, coal-mine underground wireless communication, and e-tag personal identification), 3) computational intelligence (computational neuroscience, SHESN, fuzzy neural network, fuzzy reinforcement learning, asynchronous learning control, and biologically inspired intelligence), 4) complex network theory, 5) computational biology (ncRNA gene prediction, ncRNA folding algorithm, and gene regulatory network modeling), and 6) virtual reality. Currently, I focus on the development of a new generation of UAVs and the fundamental research of expanded SHESN with significant neurobiological characteristics. 
 I received the B.S. degree from Sichuan University, Chengdu, in 1986 and the Ph.D. degree from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, in 1991, respectively, both in computer science and automation. From 1992 to 1994, as a postdoctoral researcher at Tsinghua University, my research interests were fuzzy neural network models, various fast BP learning algorithms, and asynchronous learning control. In 1994, I became an associate professor. From 1996 to 1997, I served as a research associate at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. During that period, I mainly worked on reinforcement learning approaches. From 2001 to 2003, I was a visiting professor at Washington University in St. Louis, where I took part in the R D of NSF and DARPA projects related to networked embedded system technologies (NEST) and novel ncRNA gene prediction. I have been a full professor at Tsinghua University since 2000.
