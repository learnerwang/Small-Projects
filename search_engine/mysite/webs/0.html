 Education background 
 Bachelor of Computer Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 1985; 
 Master of Computer Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 1988; 
 Ph.D. in Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 1991. 
 Areas of Research Interests/ Research Projects 
 Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition 
 International Joint Projects: Vision Computing Technologies for Face and Human Body Image and Video Processing (2002-2011); 
 National Natural Science Foundation of China: Face-Based Content Indexing and Retrieval in Image and Video (2006-2009). 
 Research Status 
 My research group focuses on visual computing subjects in the areas of computer vision and pattern recognition. Choosing face and human body as two specific visual targets, we have been doing researches on object detection, tracking, alignment, pose estimation, and recognition in the past decade. Our research outputs include high-performance rotation-invariant face detection algorithm, real-time face and head tracking algorithm, face alignment algorithm, human detection and tracking algorithm, human pose estimation algorithm, feasible human re-identification approaches, etc. The face detection algorithm we developed, which has been successfully used in many products, is regarded as one of the world's best. Potential applications of our research reside in the domains of human-computer interaction, visual surveillance, and video analysis and content extraction. 
 We have published over 80 papers in peer-reviewed journals and international conferences, including 2 TPAMI regular papers and 7 conference papers in ICCV, CVPR, and ECCV (3 oral papers). My student's paper, in which I was also a co-author, won the Best Student Paper of CVPR 2007. One of my Ph.D. student's thesis received Beijing City Excellent Ph.D. Thesis Award in 2008. I own a granted international patent, and have 4 pending patent applications. 
 I am senior member of IEEE and member of IEEE Computer Society. 
 Honors And Awards
