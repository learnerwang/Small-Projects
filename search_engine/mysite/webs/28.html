 Research Status 
 As the leading scientist and professor in computer architecture, I have been directing the research of our department in four areas, namely Computer Cluster, CPU Design, Grid and Cloud computing, and Network Storage and Disaster Recovery. 
 1. In computer cluster area, I led the development of  Tsinghua Discovery Series Computer Clusters , which have been applied to many fields such as weather forecast and network information security. We have gained practical experience in cluster design and assessment. Specifically, we have designed a user-level file system to support consistent file states for checkpoint and restart. Its related paper was published in ACM ICS 2008. The OpenMP Compiler we developed and released has been adopted by HP and AMD as the compiler for their products, and by many foreign universities as the platform for their research. We have also developed a suite of cluster assessment techniques that cover the full system, and are able to identify various system faults caused by hardware, software installation, system configuration and driver mismatch. 
 2. In CPU design area, I led the development of THUMP107, an embedded CPU running at the highest frequency in China at that time. Based on this work, we have put forward a new  Network on Chip  (NoC) architecture in which NoC, instead of CPU, maintains the consistency of cache. With computing and communication separated, this architecture eases the design of multicore CPUs and enhances the scalability of CPU. 
 3. In grid and cloud computing area, we have proposed a method for deploying grid services dynamically and remotely without restarting the service container. This technology has been adopted by Globus Toolkits 4 (GT4), the most famous grid middleware around the world. I led the development of Network Computing and Application System for Bioinformatics, which has been put into operation with over 50,000 daily users. We have developed a community-based data sharing and storage technology, as well as methods of automatic on-demand software deployment and quick virtual cluster construction. Based on the above work, we developed Tsinghua Cloud, the first cloud computing platform in China with more than 15,000 registered users and 400 communities. 
 4. In network storage and disaster recovery area, we have put forward a flexible and scalable network storage architecture, and developed  Tsinghua Mass Storage Network System  (TH-MSNS), which has nearly 100 successful deployments in industries and areas of audit, public security, telecommunication, and education. We devised ways of scaling striped volumes of array and out-of-band storage, and published related papers in ACM Transactions on Storage and IEEE Transactions on Computers, respectively. We developed a new coding scheme, named GRID, which has features of high fault tolerance and high storage utilization, and is regarded as one of the most classic erasure codes by IEEE Fellow Darrell D.E. Long. We also developed structure-independent techniques for the fast disaster recovery of data centers, which greatly reduce the investment for disaster recovery, improving recovery speed at the same time.
