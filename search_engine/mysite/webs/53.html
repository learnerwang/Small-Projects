 Research Status 
 In my graduate studies and postdoc work between 1998 and 2004, I focused on computational geometry and developing efficient algorithms for practical industrial applications. I have proposed an optimal polynomial algorithm that requires a minimal number of setups of workpiece in 4-axis NC machining. The algorithm has been proved to offer an approximate solution with a tightly-bounded performance ratio to an NP-complete problem. I have also proposed an efficient polynomial algorithm that is general and able to answer a series of inquiries concerning the intersection relations between a movable convex object and a set of planar polygons, given the previously best results needing to invoke several independent algorithms with different configuration-space models. The robot industry has shown great interests in my general model, especially its application in motion planning. I also worked on the industrial application of reverse engineering, in which I designed an optimal O(nlogn) algorithm that reconstructs water-tight and feature-preserving triangular meshes from non-uniform and unorganized point data. I contributed to an out-of-core algorithm that can deal with huge meshes and guarantee the 2-manifoldness of mesh models. The output 3D mesh models of this algorithm are readily to be manufactured using techniques such as rapid prototyping. 
Since 2004, I have been focusing on intelligent processing of visual media, synthesizing techniques in computer graphics, human-computer interaction, pattern recognition and artificial intelligence, and building practical industrial-strength systems. I have successfully developed a plush toy design system using editable sketching curves, which has inspiring results. Sophisticated toy models can be easily designed with this system by novices mimicking traditional paper-and-pencil-based 2D/3D sketches. This system has been commercialized by a Chinese company, bringing 100k USD's revenue every year. To address the issues of knowledge representation and reasoning across domains in concurrent engineering, I have also proposed an integration framework with a semantic feature model, which provides a practical solution to knowledge capture and can be consistently reused in different domains of concurrent engineering. Currently, I am building an ontology representation for visual media, in which methods of logical inference in artificial intelligence can be utilized to achieve efficient knowledge representation and data mining.
