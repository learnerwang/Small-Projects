 Research Status 
 I am interested in the research of Micro-Architecture, Computer Architecture, Cluster Computing, and Cloud Computing. My previous contributions include:  
1) My research group has designed and implemented six kinds of cluster-software for Itanium architecture, including parallel checkpoint/recovery system, parallel debugger and so on. It is the first open-source cluster software suite for Itanium architecture. As a founding member, our group publicly released this software on Gelato Federation (www.gelato.org), which is a global technical community dedicated to advancing Linux on the Intel Itanium platform. My group is also the first to develop the parallel checkpoint/recovery/migration systems for both Itanium clusters and Windows NT clusters. 
2) My research group has developed several micro-processor simulation platforms. Based on these platforms, research on micro-architecture, on-chip network and others has been launched. For example, based on the cycle-accurate processor simulator, my group has completed the architecture design, simulation and verification of an embedded processor supported by an 863 program. The processor's frequency reached 400 MHz with .18 CMOS technology. Moreover, the FPGA-based hardware/software hybrid simulator is currently used for the evaluation and performance analysis of Chinese high-end fault-tolerant computers. 
3) We also carry out research on application-level virtualization. Our prototype allows any user to access his/her personalized Windows software on any compatible networked PC without installation. This technique employs portable devices and/or network storage as the storage location, and is totally transparent to existing software. It has been applied to the instant software deployment in Corona, a cloud computing system for research at Tsinghua University. Moreover, it enables the software to be stored on the cloud and run on a local computer, which can transparently convert any existing software to a network service.
