 Areas of Research Interests/ Research Projects 
 Robot Intelligent Control 
Visual Object Tracking 
 National Natural Science Foundation of China: Hinf Control and Filtering for Markov Jumping Systems (2006-2008); 
National 863 High-Tech Program: Key Technologies of Robotic Tele-Operation (2007-2010). 
 Research Status 
 To address the non-linear and multiple-time scale difficulties existing in flexible systems, we have proposed a novel fuzzy singularly perturbed model, and developed a robust controller design approach using convex optimization. Some representative work has been published in IEEE Trans. on Fuzzy Systems (regular paper) and Fuzzy Sets and Systems (full paper). 
We utilized Markov Jumping Model to describe the problems of packet loss and time delay in current networks, and investigated the issues of robust control and filtering in these methods. In addition, facing difficulties that jumping mode cannot be measured in real-time, we have researched on the design approaches of mode-independent controllers and filers. Some representative work has been published in IEEE Trans. On Automatic Control, Automatica and IEEE Trans. on Circuits and Systems II. 
We have developed a series of experimental platforms of mobile robots (intelligent vehicles) and space tele-operation robots. We have also incorporated machine learning techniques into particle filters, and developed a series of robust visual tracking algorithms. Some representative work has been published in ICRA 2007-2009, ICASSSP 2009, and IROS 2007 and 2009.
