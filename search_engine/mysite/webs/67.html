 Education background 
 Bachelor of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 1982; 
Master of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 1985; 
Ph.D. in Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA, 1994. 
 Areas of Research Interests/ Research Projects 
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms and Systems 
Algorithm Design and Analysis 
 The National Basic Research Program of China (The 973 Program): Study in Multi-Level and Multi-Scale Physical Mechanism in Material Design (2007-2011);  
National 863 High-Tech Program: Research on Core Technologies and Systems for Pervasive Computing (2009-2010). 
 Research Status 
 My main research area is high performance computing, including advanced computer architecture, parallel and distributed algorithms, and its applications. I have participated in various projects of designing and building supercomputers, and have ported many application programs to supercomputers. In developing supercomputer applications, I have collaborated with many people from different areas of science such as material science, mechanical engineering, astrophysics, thermal energy research, and climate modeling. My research group has been investigating the methods to improve the performance (speedup, efficiency, scalability, etc.) of application programs. 
Another research area of my group is software infrastructure for pervasive computing and its applications. This research effort is mainly on service-oriented architecture support. We have introduced aspect-oriented programming technologies into the framework of pervasive computing to support flexible context-awareness. With the maturing of virtualization and distributed computing, we will study their applications in pervasive computing.  
My group also put efforts on the study of numerical linear algebra. The beauty of mathematics is greatly appreciated by me. Large-scale matrix computation is the core component in many HPC applications. We have designed a couple of stable algorithms for preconditioning linear least square problems. Currently, my group is designing scalable parallel algorithms to solve non-negative linear least square problems. With multi-core and many-core becoming the mainstream of computer architecture, this area will continuously be our research interests.
