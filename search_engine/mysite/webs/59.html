 Research Status 
 My research interests include visualization, image-based modeling and rendering (IBMR), medical image processing, and wavelet analysis and its application.  
I have done various visualization research and application projects on terrain data, dental cast, visual human, and lunar surface and solar wind ion data provided by Chang'E-1 Exploration Satellite.  
In IBMR, I have proposed an IBR algorithm based on Weak Perspective model, a 3D recovery method of specular surface using color highlight stripe and light source coding, a structured light inspection method on specular surfaces using Quaternary Coding, and an efficient algorithm to reconstruct 3D surface with two image pairs based on Helmholtz Reciprocity. 
In recent years, supported by National 863 High-Tech Program and National Natural Science Foundation of China, I have been investigating post-processing issues of OCT images, such as image classification and layer detection. I have developed effective automated techniques of measuring pearl thickness, cornea thickness, and anterior chamber depth. I have also proposed an OCT image classification method.  
Wavelet analysis is my favorite research field. In particular, I focus on wavelet construction, fast algorithm of wavelet transform, and its applications in geometric modeling and image processing. I began to study wavelet and its applications in geometric modeling and volume visualization in 1996 when I was a Ph.D. student in Beihang University. Then, as a postdoc in Tsinghua University, I shifted my focus to problems of symmetric lifting factorization, fast implementation of biorthogonal wavelet transform, and its application in DEM compression. In 2005, my book-Wavelet Analysis and its Applications-was published. In recent years, I mainly investigate the algebraic construction method of orthogonal and bi-orthogonal wavelet filters, the lifting construction method of dyadic wavelet, and two-dimensional stationary dyadic wavelet transforms. 
My research contributions are as followed: 
1) In wavelet, I proposed a constructive method of lifting constructing spline dyadic wavelets with arbitrary numbers of vanishing moments. For bi-orthogonal finite filters, I proved that there exists one and only one symmetric factorization of the polyphase matrix, and that the symmetric factorization can be determined directly and efficiently. Symmetric implementation and matrix representation of biorthogonal wavelet transforms are also given. Recently, I have proposed a two-dimensional stationary dyadic wavelet transform and its fast algorithm, which, different from classical two-dimensional dyadic wavelet transform, is essentially an extension of two-dimensional stationary wavelet transform for orthogonal/bi-orthogonal wavelet filters. Those theories and algorithms have great potential in research and application of dyadic wavelet. 
2) I have proposed a novel method for automated classification of OCT images based on local features and earth mover's distance (EMD). It is the first work to use local features for solving the problem of OCT image classification.
