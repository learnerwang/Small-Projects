 Research Status 
 My research interests are mainly in computer vision and human-computer interaction. We are working on the theories and systems of distributed computer vision for assisted living. Currently, we have put our efforts on the researches of 2D/3D non-rigid motion estimation, affective computing, and brain-computer interaction. Our papers have been published on ICVS, ECCV, IEEE Trans. of PAMI, IEEE Trans. of SMC, etc.
