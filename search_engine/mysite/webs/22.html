 Research Status 
 I have been focusing on the area of computer networks, and have produced some outputs in the research of High-Performance IPv4/IPv6 Routers, High-Performance Networks, Internet Routing, and IPv4/IPv6 Transition. 
 1. My research group is among a few Chinese institutes who started early in the research of high-performance routers. I have presided over or participated in the research of low- and medium-end routers based on single and multiple processors, respectively, and the research of high-end routers based on hardware forwarding. In 2000, we pioneered the research on high-performance IPv6 routers, and succeeded in the end of 2003. In March 2004, our IPv6 Core Router passed the network entrance test by Ministry of Information Industry, becoming the first Chinese IPv6 high-end router equipment to pass this test. At present, our research results have been industrialized and widely deployed in networks such as CERNET2, China Telecom, and China mobile, bringing huge economic and social benefits. 
 2. As an expert in committees of two 863 major projects-CainoNet and 3TNet, I participated in the development of the first high-performance network in China, in which all G/T-bit routers bear Chinese intellectual properties. Besides, we have, in those two projects, built a general technology specification for G/T-bit routers, designed an integrated network management scheme, and achieved the uniform management of IP and optical equipments. 
 3. By analyzing network failures in CNGI-CERNET2 and other networks, my research group studied the stability and self-healing features of internet routing, and proposed a low-cost selective intra-domain routing protection scheme and other inter-domain stable routing schemes. Those research results were published in INFOCOM, ICDCS and other conferences. An IETF draft was submitted and ten patents were applied. 
 4. To address the issue of transition between IPv4 multicast and IPv6 multicast, we have proposed an IPv4 over IPv6 mesh network transition mechanism, which extends BGP protocol, automatically transmits networks reachability information, and guarantees transparency, scalability and efficiency during IPv4 and IPv6 network fusion. We have submitted four IETF drafts, one of which has become RFC standard. We have also submitted two drafts of CCSA, one of which has been approved.
