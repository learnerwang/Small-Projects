 Research Status 
 My research interests are mainly the applications of computer graphics algorithms and techniques, computational geometry, and parallel architectures to Scientific Visualization. I have presented a method to augment frequency-domain volume rendering with higher reality by substance classification and color assignment. I have developed a cluster-based parallel volume rendering system, which enables collaboration among various operating systems such as Windows, Unix (Solaris, Irix), Linux, etc. My research group has presented a GPU-based algorithm for real-time collision detection in sophisticated scenes by monotone decomposition of the 3D models.
