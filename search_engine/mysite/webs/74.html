 Education background 
 Bachelor of Computer Science   Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 1996; 
Master of Computer Science   Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 1998; 
Ph.D. in Computer Science   Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 2006. 
 Areas of Research Interests/ Research Projects 
 Parallel and Distributed Systems  
Storage System 
 National Basic Research Program of China (The 973 Program): Research on Structure-Independent Disaster Recovery Techniques and Implementations (2007-2011). 
 Research Status 
 My research interests are parallel, distributed, and storage systems. I have carried out one of the first measurement studies of large VOD systems, and indicated user behavior and content access patterns of such systems, and their implications in designing multimedia streaming systems. I have also developed a new data protection and recovery system based on OS virtualization techniques, which can instantly restore the interrupted services to a normal running state after disasters without the support of expensive hot standby solutions. 
 Honors And Awards 
 National Science and Technology Progress Award, Second Class-High-Performance Cluster Computers and Large-Scale Storage Systems (2007); 
Science and Technology Progress Award by Ministry of Education, First Class-Whole-Process Evaluation Techniques and Applications of High-Performance Computing Systems (2009).
