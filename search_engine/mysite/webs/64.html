 Research Status 
 My main research interests lie in vision navigation of intelligent vehicle and mobile robots, in particular road and lane detection, obstacle detection, fast and robust circle and ellipse detection, and multi-sensor based intelligent perception. In recent years, I have also involved in the research of affective computing, medical image processing, etc. I have participated in the development of two intelligent mobile robots, THMR-III and THMR-V (Tsinghua Mobile Robot).  
1. My research group has proposed a road-area detection algorithm based on color images. This algorithm overcomes both edge detection inaccuracy of the intensity image method and computational complexity of existing color image segmentation algorithms. The paper was published in  IEEE Trans. on Intelligent Transportation Systems , and has been cited by others over 10 times (all by International Journals). 
2. My research group has also proposed a fast and robust, stereovision-based obstacle detection method. A watershed transformation is employed for obstacle segmentation in dense traffic conditions (even with partial occlusions) of urban environments. The paper was published in  Autonomous Robots . It was regarded as one of the main progress of intelligent vehicles by EU. 
3. Besides, a real-time lane detection algorithm was proposed based on the hyperbola-pair model. It effectively serves complex conditions including roads with colored lane marks and special traffic marks, and night driving. Our lane detection system has also been adopted by other countries.  
4. A more meaningful result of our research is real-time detection of circle and ellipse from complex background. My research group proposed a fast contour-based algorithm of circle and ellipse detection, which dramatically reduces the cost of both memory and computation. This algorithm and its detection system has received a Chinese patent, and has been applied in cruising and inspecting mobile robots for transformer stations.
