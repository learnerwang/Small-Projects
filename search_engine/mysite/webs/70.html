 Research Status 
 My research team mainly focuses on evolutionary computation, intelligent information processing method, and integrating advanced process control technologies into circuit manufacturing equipments. In evolutionary computation, we work on the current estimation method by means of multi-variable distributed optimization algorithm, aiming at improving its convergence rate and the quality of optimal solutions. Our research on intelligent information processing utilizes machine learning algorithms to process Internet text messages and analyze the emotions hidden behind them. Research on advanced control technologies for integrated circuit manufacturing equipments focuses on developing clustered control software and platforms for IC manufacturing equipments.  
We have proposed L1BOA, a multivariate Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA), which uses L1-regularized regression to learn the structure of Bayesian networks. In L1BOA, structural learning is embedded within the process of parameter estimation, with the aim to build to a sparse but nearly optimized network structure. Compared with the classical Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA), L1BOA is able to improve the efficiency of structure learning and automatically control the structure complexity. 
Our achievements in the field of cluster control technologies for IC manufacturing equipments include etching machines for 200mm IC equipment and its control system. By 2007, we have successfully industrialized our technologies, applying them to the mainstream of 200mm and 300mm integrated circuit production lines. Our work in this field has received multiple science and technology progress awards.
