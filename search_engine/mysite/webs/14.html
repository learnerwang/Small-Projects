 Research Status 
 My research group pay attention to human computer interaction, pervasive computing, network multimedia and e-learning technologies. 
 We proposed protocols like TORM (Totally Ordered Reliable Multicasting) and PowerP2P (for layered streaming) to provide good QoS for multimedia communication over Internet. TORM was adopted by an enterprise in 2004 in their successful development of IPTV business. 
 My research group set up Smart Space lab in 2000 to study Pervasive Computing problems. We've developed a software platform for spontaneous interoperation among devices and users in smart space. Based on this platform, several multimodal interfaces and indoor location sensors were developed. We have also built prototype systems of Smart Classroom, SEMIC (intelligent meeting environment) and Smart Home. This comprehensive research leads the pervasive computing research in China in a sense. I initiated the Technical Committee of Pervasive Computing in China Computer Federation in 2005 and was elected as the chair. 
 I've been paying more attention to natural human computer interfaces and efficient user interaction recently. We've been developing uTable-a large interactive tabletop system-since 2006. uTable allows multiple users to collaboratively work on the surface of a high-definition projection table by finger gestures, pen and tangible objects. We also research on the usage patterns of mobile phone based on sensor data analysis and have proposed hand gesture detection technologies for novel interactive applications. GUI optimizing and Web page adaptation are interesting topics for which we've proposed a more efficient model and analyzed methodologies and tools, respectively.
