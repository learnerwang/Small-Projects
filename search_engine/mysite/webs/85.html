 Areas of Research Interests/ Research Projects 
 Database, Information Retrieval, Data Integration 
 National 863 High-Tech Program: Effective and Efficient Keyword Search on Massive Heterogeneous Data (2007-2010). 
 Research Status 
 My research group addresses fundamental problems in the areas of keyword search in structured and semi-structured data, data integration of multiple data sources, approximate string search, and similarity join. My work in particular aims at seamlessly integrating databases and information retrieval techniques, making databases more user-friendly and easily accessible. 
 I have proposed a 3-in-1 keyword search method, which provides a unified search interface for unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first work to address this problem. I have also proposed a new search paradigm, which provides answers immediately as users type in keywords, improving their search experiences. This method extends traditional auto-completion techniques by supporting full-text search and tolerating minor discrepancies between queries and the underlying data. 
 My two papers in ACM SIGMOD 2008 and CIKM 2007 have, in total, more than 90 citations, 40 of which come from top journals and conferences such as ACM TODS, VLDB Journal, IEEE TKDE, ACM SIGMOD, VLDB, and IEEE TKDE. I have filed a US patent for type-ahead search, which has been licensed by an American company. 
 Honors And Awards 
 IBM Ph.D. Fellowship (2008).
