 Research Status 
 I have directed many research projects sponsored by National Basic Research Program, National Natural Science Foundation, and National 863 High-Tech Program since 2003. Based on the above work, we have published more than 85 papers in referred international journals like Journal of Grid Computing, Concurrency and Computation: Practice   Experience, Nucleic Acids Research, and Nano Letters, and conferences like CCGrid, Grid, ICNP, ICDCS, IPTPS, and ICPP. Our key achievements are as follows: 
 1. We have researched on the ways of analyzing the performance of computing grid and put forward a range-based approach to predicting grid performance. The results were published in Grid and CCGrid. I have also directed the development of Corsair, the first cloud storage product system in China. Now, Corsair is of 100TB storage with more than 15,000 registered users and 300 communities. Each day, it has more than 3,000 visits and as high as 1.3TB data traffic. 
 2. We have developed a Java-based parallel computing environment that enables users to transparently compile and run parallel programs on heterogeneous clusters. We have studied the ways to analyze and optimize high-performance computing programs. Our joint work with Department of Materials has produced a published paper  Icosahedral FACE-Centered Cubic Fe Nanoparticles  in Nano Letters, which is one of the most famous journals on nano research. 
 3. I have put forward a new multi-level partitioning (MLP) strategy for facilitating keyword searching in structured peer-to-peer systems. Compared with query flooding and inverted list intersection schemes, MLP can dramatically reduce bisection backbone bandwidth and communication latency. The paper about our detailed work in this area was published in IPTPS 2004, and has got 58 citations so far according to Google Scholar. 
 4. In earth system simulation, we have optimized the high-resolution atmospheric model gamil (360*180) and made it possible to efficiently utilize 480 CPU cores. In earth system model, we have developed many high-performance interpolation algorithms for couplers. All the above work provides a good basis for earth system research.
