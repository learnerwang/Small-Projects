 Research Status 
 I have been working on quantum computing and quantum information theory for over eight years, and have made some significant contributions in the areas of quantum process algebra, quantum programming theory, quantum state/operation discrimination, and quantum entanglement transformation. I have co-authored nearly 40 research papers in top international journals such as  IEEE Trans. on Information Theory ,  IEEE Trans. on Computers ,  ACM Trans. on Computational Logic ,  Physical Review Letters ,  Information and Computation ,  Theoretical Computer Science , etc. According to  Web of Science , my research has been cited more than 180 times by papers published on SCI-indexed journals. My main contributions are briefly stated as follows: 
1.  Quantum Process Algebra.  I have proposed a value-passing CCS based framework to formally model and reason about distributed quantum computing and quantum communicating protocols. Notions of strong probabilistic bisimulation and weak probabilistic bisimulation between quantum processes were introduced, and their properties were intensively examined. This work has been published on  Information and Computation , one of the most highly respected journals in computer science. The reviewers noted that  the topics addressed by this paper belong to the moving frontier of quantum computer science, and they propose and defend a lot of interesting, original and valuable ideas . This paper was ranked No.2 of the quarterly  TOP 25 Hottest Articles  of  I C  in 2007 (Oct.- Dec.), and was reviewed by  Mathematical Reviews  of the American Mathematical Society (MR2368643, reviewer: Simon J. Gay).  
2.  Quantum Programming Theory . I have proposed a pure quantum language where no classical data is involved, which can be used to describe the quantum data processing part of future quantum computers. Employing the notion of quantum weakest precondition proposed by D'Hondt and Panangaden, we analyze the correctness of quantum programs in this language. We presented a set of complete proof rules using which any correctness assertion can be proved. This work was published in  Theoretical Computer Science , a leading journal in theoretical computer science. It was ranked as No. 7 of the quarterly  TOP 25 Hottest Articles  of  TCS  in 2007 (Oct.-Dec.), and was reviewed by  Mathematical Reviews  of the American Mathematical Society (MR2351559. Reviewer: Robert S. Lubarsky).
