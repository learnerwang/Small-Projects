 Research Status 
 I am focusing on video coding technologies and their implementations on embedded systems. Since the MPEG-1 standard of video coding was released, coding efficiency has been doubled twice in the recent decade, but storage and communication bandwidth still can't catch up with the increase of video data. I dedicate myself to discovering further correlation rules in video data to improve the coding efficiency. I'm also active in participating in the standardization work of video coding. Furthermore, I am interested in the implementation of video codec in embedded systems, refining design technologies of embedded systems to support video applications on the one side, and fitting video codec to embedded systems on the other. 
 Frame rate-up technology and intra prediction technology are two research interests of mine in video coding area. Making good use of candidate motion vectors and motion search, we propose a new frame rate-up algorithm which achieves better reconstruction performance and quicker reconstruction speed. On the other hand, we found that high definition video data has stronger spatial correlation which can benefit coding efficiency. A main set and surplus set based algorithm was proposed, with related papers published on conferences such as DCC, ICIP and ISCAS. 
 An offloading framework was proposed for balancing the computation of video coding between mobile terminals and nearby powerful servers. Furthermore, we have proposed various algorithms, including Hurst Probability based DPM algorithm for low power design, real-time performance measurement and improvement algorithm in Linux kernel, rapid transcoding algorithm in the frequency domain, low-complexity mode decision algorithm based on machine learning, and parallel coding scheme towards multi-core. All the above efforts aim at making video codec fit to embedded systems better.
