 Research Status 
 After graduation from Tsinghua University, I have been doing research on automatic control. I also work on information systems. In 1985, as a visiting scholar, I went to America to study robotics. When I came back in 1986, I started to focus on intelligent robot architectures. I have undertaken and led major projects, such as National 863 High-Tech Program, to research on architecture of assembly robots. My research group has developed an opening robot controller. In 1987, I joined the Intelligent Robot Committee of National 863 High-Tech Program right after it was established, and was later appointed to as its director. From that time on, I've been doing technological management work in the committee. 
 In recent years, I have done my best to combine different technologies and seek for breakthroughs. My research group is currently researching on  Online Tele-Education System , in which we expect to achieve one-on-one teaching. In fact, we are not able to afford enough teachers to teach students online at the same time. A virtual teachers approach was proposed. According to traditional CAD methods, it's very difficult to render the facial expression of a virtual human being in real time, so as to show its lip-rounding. In order to generate facial expression in real time, a numerical model of facial expression must be firstly established. Leveraging the modeling technique in robotics, we have selected 31 facial muscles to model facial expression. With the length of these facial muscles serving as control parameters, facial expression can be numerical as well. Our algorithm has been realized in computers and has successfully achieved real-time facial expression.
