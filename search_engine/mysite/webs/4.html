 Research Status 
 I am engaging in the research and development of database-related work. I have series of research outputs and have published high quality academic papers in native XML database management system, keyword search over heterogeneous data, data security and privacy preservation, and new types of database management systems such as a column-oriented database. 
 In the area of native XML database management system, I have proposed encoding methods of XML data, methods of semantic cache, and structure-and-twig join algorithms. I have also proposed an  implicit condition homomorphism  method, which effectively resolves the problems of storage, query processing and homomorphism judgment of the XML data, and builds the general framework of query processing and query optimization for native XML database management system. 
 In the area of keyword search over heterogeneous data, I have proposed a graph model for heterogeneous data, built the indexes and ranking mechanism for keyword search over heterogeneous data, effectively resolved the problem of the unification and the query evaluation of heterogeneous data, and formed a keyword search system with auto-completion, fuzzy match and type-ahead features. At the same time, I have worked together with foreign researchers on column-oriented database and its query optimization technologies such as delay instantiation, block iteration, specific column compression and invisible join. I am currently developing a large-scale column-oriented database management system-HUABASE. 
 Combining various areas of database, data mining and information retrieval, my research achievements have broadened the field of database research, which also attracted wide attentions from the academic society. My published papers have been cited more than 180 times (130+ by others) in total. Two papers published in ACM SIGMOD and ACM CIKM conferences respectively have been cited more than 80 times from more than 10 countries in two years. There are more than 40 citations from top conferences and journals in database research, such as ACM SIGMOD, VLDB, IEEE ICDE, EDBT and ACM TODS. Researchers who have cited my papers are mainly from leading universities such as MIT, UIUC, DUKE, Wisconsin, Arizona State University, Ohio State University, NUS, MPI, etc.
