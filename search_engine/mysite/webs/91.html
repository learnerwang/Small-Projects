 Areas of Research Interests/ Research Projects 
 Visual Information Analysis and Retrieval 
 National Natural Science Foundation of China: Research on Semantic Modeling for Large Quantity Videos (2007-2009). 
 Research Status 
 My research focuses on visual information analysis and retrieval, whose purpose is to improve the precision and recall rate of image and video retrieval with the help of machine learning algorithms. Some of my research results have been published in journals such as IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology and conferences including ACM Multimedia. 
 In the area of visual information analysis, my contributions include a semantic modeling method which fuses rich features under boost framework, and a region annotation method using spatial context in the view of structural prediction. In visual information retrieval, I have investigated methods of extracting users' information requirements from queries and feedbacks. Besides, I have proposed new training and prediction methods for SVM, aiming to support real-time interactive video search. I have also developed a high-performance indexing algorithm for large-scale, high-dimensional databases. 
 Our visual information analysis system has achieved best performance for several times in TRECVID, a benchmark for content based video retrieval. Furthermore, some of my proposed algorithms have been adopted in monitoring and management systems for video and audio programs over Internet, and have been deployed in several departments and provincial governments since 2007. 
 Honors And Awards
