 Research Status 
 My recent research interests are all Web-related, focusing on Web vertical search, Web information extraction, and knowledge discovery. 
 In Web vertical search, we treat World Wide Web as a major information resource for diverse application domains, such as sales of book, scientific publications, etc. To collect the data for such a domain from the Web, we proposed a stepwise methodology that covers the process of domain specification, crawling, extraction, and database building from the Web. The process is fully supported by a domain independent system called SESQ having a graph language GQML as a tool for the process tasks. The built-in query processor of SESQ supports queries on the extracted databases in the form of keyword, SQL-like statements, and GUI as well. SESQ was a highlight of the ALVIS project jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the EU 6th FP Program. 
 As the Chinese Web, that is the Web consisting of all webpages from China, is becoming more and more important to Chinese people and the World Wide Web, I turn much of my research attention to knowledge discovery of it. 
 Building a bilingual dictionary from bilingual HTML webpages has been a topic for years in natural language processing (NLP) area. Existing work in NLP uses complicated machine learning and Chinese segmentation algorithms, and relies on preexisting language resources such as corpus, and thus suffers from scalability problem. Based on hundreds of millions of Chinese-English HTML pages crawled by an industrial search engine, our group has developed a self-dependent method for building a Chinese-English bilingual dictionary. The method uses a self-built corpus and an algorithm based on I-Tree data structure to get term translations. By avoiding complicated machine learning and segmentation algorithms, the implemented method has a good scalability and is portable to various languages. Comparative testing with a popular bilingual dictionary shows a performance advantage of our method. A patent has been applied for our proposed method. 
 Another interesting research we have done by using many millions of HTML pages crawled by an industrial search engine is an investigation of the Web databases on Chinese Web. Given these pages as input, our group has designed algorithms of webpage filtering, feature extraction, and classifications to get an overview of the Chinese Deep Web. Our investigation, which is closer to the real status of Chinese Web than traditional sampling methods, shows at present on Chinese Web there are over 600,000 web databases. Among them half are in the category of e-business and web based trading, and the rest are distributed over domains such as science and technology, education, entertainment, etc. Another noticeable fact is that half of Chinese Web databases only have a single box as their input interface. These interesting facts provide an initial base for further research on Chinese Deep Web. 
 Web community mining is another research that our group focuses on. We construct large scale graphs with millions of nodes and hundreds of millions of edges from the Web by using various associations between entities, and study algorithms on mining communities from these graphs with more emphasis on the aspects of accuracy and scalability. We propose an algorithm to utilize the dynamic process by contradicting the network topology and the topology-based propinquity, where the propinquity is a measure of the probability for a pair of nodes involved in a coherent community structure. Through several rounds of mutual reinforcement between topology and propinquity, the community structures are expected to naturally emerge. To achieve better efficiency, the propinquity is incrementally calculated. We obtained interesting experimental results on several real network data. This work has been published in ACM SIGKDD '09 conference. Our other contributions in Web community mining can be found in top international conference VLDB 2009 and ACM journal TODS, June 2007.
