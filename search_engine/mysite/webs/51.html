 Research Status 
 My research group is interested in Chinese language comprehension, cognitive computation of auditory and visual information and intelligent processing of multimedia information, focused in particular on the cognitive mechanisms of auditory and visual information  in videos of real-world events  in the human brain. 
We have systematically studied the cognitive processing of audio-visual information, including Chinese language comprehension, interaction between pictures and words, emotional cognition, and cognitive computation of audio-visual information in videos of real-world events. The corresponding results have been reported in some top-ranking or important international journals. 
In the study of Chinese language comprehension,  we have verified that  Chinese function words are  grammaticalized  from content words, and that phonological processing is independent from semantic and syntactic processing, as well as that the monitoring theory model is confirmed in Chinese language comprehension. In the study of the processing of phonological, orthographical, and lexical information of Chinese characters in sentence contexts, we have verified that the direct access hypothesis or the dual-route hypothesis could better explain cognitive processing in the brain. 
In the study of interaction between pictures and words, based on the  positivity  offset and negativity bias theories we have found that actual arousal levels of multiple stimuli are different from those of individual pictures and individual words, while the actual arousal levels of individual pictures do not differ significantly from those of individual words. Content consistency can lead to a reduction in emotional attention, and also the influence of pictures on words will differ from the opposite condition. 
In the study of influence on cognitive processing from the switches of shooting angles in the videos of real-world events, we have found that when subjects were concerned with the video contents, the switches of shooting angles would distract their attention from the video contents, but as long as the semantic meaning of the videos were coherent, the switches of shooting angles would not lead to significant difficulties in semantic comprehension. And the P 3a  and RON generally reflect the processing of task-irrelevant visual stimuli. 
In the study of  multisensory  integration, we have verified that the P400 waveform might be related to the cognitive integration processing of mismatched  multisensory  information in the human brain, and synchronized  multisensory  information would interfere with each other. We have also confirmed that the  multisensory  integration can be observed no matter if the SOA between the auditory and visual information in the  multisensory  stimuli remains small or large, and the  multisensory  integration could be influenced by the temporal asynchrony in the processing of asynchronous audio-visual stimuli of real-world events. Longer  SOAs  can weaken  multisensory  integration, and there are rules as follows: AV V_A A_V.
