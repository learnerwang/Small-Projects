 Research Status 
 My research focuses on algorithms in Electronic Design Automation and VLSI Physical Design Automation. I am interested in emerging fields as technology advances, such as 3D IC design automation, ultra large and mixed mode placement, interconnect planning and optimization, and programmable technology. 
 3D IC design is a new field which can extend Moore's Law. My research group's interests in 3D IC physical design automation aim at area, wire-length, and thermal optimization. We address the problems of runtime inefficiency and thermal issue in 3D layout. We work on novel physical design algorithms based on the hierarchical design concept and divide-and-conquer technique to reduce design complexity introduced by the 3rd dimension. As technology advances, IC goes larger and larger. We are attempting to find a fast algorithm to solve the problems in ultra-large and mixed-mode placement, such as multiple objectives, many constraints, and clock node distributions. We have proposed some methods for interconnect planning and optimization for low-power, thermal and yield-in nanometer IC design. We have also investigated in the FPGA design automation methodologies and have implemented various algorithms for technology mapping, placement and routing.
