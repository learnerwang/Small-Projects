 Research Status 
 In the field of intelligent control and systems, aiming at addressing major application problems, my research group conducts research on intelligent control methods. Our work includes robust control, intelligent modeling, complex image recognition, etc. These studies have also expanded the application fields for intelligent methods. The introduction of intelligent methods definitely improves the performance of applications system, and on the other hand, the application evokes further research of relevant methods. The intelligent methods we have proposed include: Robust Tracking Control of Wheeled Mobile Robot and Monocular Vision-based SLAM, Ultra-Precision Motion Control and High-Precision Image Positioning, and Pattern Recognition Method in Plant Identification. The application systems we have developed include: Omni-Directional Mobile Robot System, Lithography Transmission Control Systems, Image-based High-precision TFT-LCD Alignment System, Remote Diagnosis and Evaluation Control Systems, Precise Robotic Grinding Systems, Minimally Invasive Surgery Systems using Image-navigating Robot, etc.
