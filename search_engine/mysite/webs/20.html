 Research Status 
 My research mainly focuses on distributed computing and processing, which include Grid Computing and Cloud Computing. With ChinaGrid, China National Grid, and Tsinghua Cloud as my research foundation, I have proposed various mechanisms for the management and scheduling of distributed resources. Furthermore, I also work on auto-deployment methods of system software/services/applications in distributed environments. Another research stream of mine is data-intensive distributed applications, especially distributed data file system and management. 
 Through a large-scale empirical study of HPC Systems' traces, I have proposed an adaptive workload prediction model with confidence windows. It has been applied to job scheduling of HPC systems and is capable of improving their throughput. In order to improve the efficiency of Grid/Cloud computing, a hybrid system mechanism is put forward by me to flexibly allocate physical or virtualized resources according to application requirements. Moreover, this mechanism also supports on-demand deployment of virtual machines and applications. 
 Hot deployment technologies of ChinaGrid Support Platform, of which I am the team leader, have been adopted by Globus Toolkits 4-a well-known grid middleware. Tsinghua Cloud, developed by my research group, is also cited by CloudBook, and its cloud storage platform has been serving Tsinghua University teachers and students since Nov. 2008.
