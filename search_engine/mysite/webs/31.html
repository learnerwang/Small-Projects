 Research Status 
 My group mainly engaged in the theoretical research related to flight control field and the engineering development in recent years. The main work on research and science and technological application is as follows: 
 1.The  dual-redundancy  switching ring network connection in FC link points and node bypass circuit are invented. Embedded  Dual-redundancy  FC communication processor based on PMC bus is developed successfully. Autonomous FC light weight protocol (FC-LP)is presented and realized as well. 
 2.Multi-redundant force-free dispute electromechanics is invented. Force dispute problem that universally exist in multi-redundant electromechanics is resolved.  Redundancy control  based on the controllers which has cross datalink between each other is invented. Besides,  Dissimilar redundancy   displacement   measurement technology  is presented. And  Fault-tolerability  and the  reliability  of the system are improved without extra hardware cost. 
 3.The  optical fiber transmission  flight control  architecture  is presented based on the unified fiber network.  Distributed  triple redundancy  optical fiber transmission   flight control computer  based on  dual-redundancy  FC  arbitration  ring network and the  distributed   fault-tolerant method  and redundancy management method based on fiber transmission bus are invented. Real-time group communication protocol and fault-tolerance distributed process system software are realized based on soft bus technology. Dynamic management and redundancy resource distribution method are presented. 
 The unified fiber network (FC) all-electronic control system has been used to apply for more than 30 patents. The research results have reached international advanced level and have been applied in engineering field, producing significant achievements in improving the performance and reliability of the flight control system.
