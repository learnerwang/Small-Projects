 Research Status 
 IPv4/IPv6 transition technology has been the major constraint in modern Internet development. My research team has initially proposed the 4over6 mesh architecture in the world, and designed and implemented 4over6 mesh protocol based on dynamic non-dominant tunnel. This has won high attention from IETF, and thus Softwire group was established. Based on this protocol, many national patents have been filed. I have published many papers in influential journals in the network field such as IEEE Internet Computing, and accomplished RFC 5565 and RFC 5747. Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA) has assigned a specific sub-address cluster identifier SAFI=67 to identify 4over6 function of network nodes. This protocol has been deployed to large-scale test on CERNET2, providing significant solution for pure IPv6 backbone building and IPv6 transition. It has been remarked as an international initiative by the technical appraisal committee including ten CAS and CAE fellows, and won the First-class Prize of Science and Technology Progress Award by Ministry of Education in 2007.  
Core routers are the key equipment of the Internet. I have participated in the overall design of IPv6 core routers, proposed IPv4 over IPv6 tunnel, and been responsible for the design and implementation of the subsystem. Having passed technical appraisal, our overall technology reaches international advanced and national top level. It has made major innovation in four key technologies including the tunnel setup scheme of realizing IPv4 on IPv6 networks. Among them, IPv4 over IPv6 tunnel and other two technologies have reached international advanced level. I have received the Second-class Award of National Science and Technology Progress Award, and Significant Technological Innovation Award by Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. 
Wireless network and mobile computing are significant directions of future Internet. I have studied the collaborative optimization routing framework based on backbone and access networks. Game optimization has been made on network transmission and user access. Multi-channel multi-path mesh backbone routing protocol has been designed using cross-level technologies. Besides, data center-oriented wireless mesh networking architecture and its key technologies have been proposed. Based on those research results, many important papers have been published, and my research group has been supported by Natural Science Foundation, international joint programs, and other funding.
