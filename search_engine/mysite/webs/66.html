 Research Status 
 My research group works on the methodologies and tools for a programmer to improve coding quality, especially for safety and correctness purposes. Our research areas include programming models, compilers, and formal verification. I am particular interested in the concurrent program issues in those areas. 
In my current research, I'm developing a transactional concurrent programming model based on Petri nets. Explicit concurrency among cooperative transactions can undoubtedly decrease the rate of conflicts and improve the performance, but unfortunately it is harmful to the correctness. In one of my projects, concurrency among transactions is programmed based on special colored Petri nets, which facilitates programmers in writing correct transactional concurrent programs while maintaining a low overhead. 
I have before proposed a theory to improve the hierarchical modeling capability of a Petri net by classifying its elements into groups, which is helpful to specifying the behavioral reuse of concurrent object-oriented systems, as well as aspect-oriented components.
