 Education background 
 Bachelor of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 1999; 
Ph.D. in Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 2004. 
 Areas of Research Interests/ Research Projects 
 Storage Systems, Distributed Systems 
 National Natural Science Foundation of China: Research on Key Technologies of Network-based Virtualization of Multiple Computing Resources (2010-2012); 
National Basic Research Program of China (The 973 Program): Research on the Virtualization of Multiple Computing Resources (2007-2011). 
 Research Status 
 My current research focuses on system virtualization. Before joining Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, I worked at Intel China Research Center where I did some research on data streaming in the grid environment. I have also worked on Chinese natural language processing while I was doing research at City University in Hong Kong between 2001 and 2002. 
We have built a system which uses virtual machines to form virtual clusters, so that users and applications can be provided with customized environment such as tailored operating systems and specified application environment. I have also done some work on distributed data processing. By using transparent data streaming mode, traditional applications that use file system for data storing can be coupled together in a network environment. In the area of Chinese natural language processing, we have proposed a method using character count of substring accessors (predecessors and successors). The larger the count value, the more likely the substring is a word. In this way, words can be extracted from a collection of raw text.
