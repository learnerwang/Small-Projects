 Areas of Research Interests/ Research Projects 
 Mobile Ad-hoc Network 
Computer Supported Cooperative Work 
 National Natural Science Foundation of China: Research on Model and Environment of Integrating Multiple Cooperative Manners (2008-2011); 
National 863 High-Tech Program: Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network and its Applications in Smart Navigation (2008-2010). 
 Research Status 
 My research interests are mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW). Currently, I am focusing on routing protocols, media access control (MAC), and applications of MANET. I am also reaching out to the research of distributed workflows and the flexibility of workflow. My research outputs include a multi-channel MAC algorithm, a power and rate-adaptive MAC algorithm, an energy-sensitive MANET routing protocol, and a pattern-oriented workflow planner. 
 Honors And Awards 
 National Award for Technical and Scientific Books by the General Administration of Press and Publication, First Class- Computer-Supported Cooperative Working-Theory and its Applications  (2001).
