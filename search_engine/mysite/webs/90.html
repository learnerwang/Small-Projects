 Education background 
 Bachelor of Computer Science, Jilin University, Changchun, China, 2000; 
 Master of Computer Science, Jilin University, Changchun, China, 2003; 
 Ph.D. in Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 2008. 
  Social service 
 Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University: Director of Graduate Management Committee (2008-2010). 
 Areas of Research Interests/ Research Projects 
 Large-scale Storage Systems; 
 Distributed Systems. 
 The National Natural Science Foundation of China:Efficient RAID Scaling in Network Storage (2010-2012); 
 The National High-Tech R D Program of China (The 863 Program): Development and Application of PB-scale High-performance Mass Storage Systems (2009-2010). 
 Research Status 
 As a principal investigator or a key technical personnel, I have taken part in multiple NSF, 863, or 973 projects. 
 I investigated the online scaling of RAID, found the reordering window characteristic in scaling a RAID volume. As a consequence, I proposed a series of efficient approaches to scaling RAID volumes, which improved the RAID scalability. 
 I have published 8 papers in journals or conferences. Among of them, one was published in ACM Transactions on Storage, and two were published in IEEE Transactions on Computers. 
 Honors And Awards 
 Ministry of Education, The People's Republic of China: ShengTeng 2600 Network Servers, Award for Science and Technology Progress, 2nd Class (2007).
