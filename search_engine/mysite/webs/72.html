 Research Status 
 My research interests are parallel algorithm as well as parallel software design and implementation for cutting-edge applications such as power system dynamic simulation, reservoir simulation, numerical weather prediction and climate system model. My research contributions include: 
 1. I have proposed a spatial parallel DAE algorithm based on sub-structure method, a multi-level convergence judgment scheme for power system dynamic simulation, as well as a novel multi-level partition scheme based on power network regional characteristics. This scheme has better computational efficiency than traditional spatial parallel algorithms and the partitions using METIS, which is a famous program used for partitioning graphs. 
 2. We have designed and implemented TH-PaPSM, a parallel software for power system dynamic simulation. TH-PaPSM is able to hold real-time simulation for huge power network with over ten-thousand nodes. Currently, TH-PaPSM has already been deployed in China Southern Power Grid. 
 3. Based on TH-PaPSM and in collaboration with Prof. Shen Chen from Dept. of EE, we have designed and implemented a distributed prototype for dynamic security analysis on large-scale power systems . We have proposed an improved quasi-Newton algorithm, a schedule scheme for multi-case, and an application-specific communication middleware over WAN. Test results showed that our system is feasible for on-line use, which cannot be achieved by known methods. 
 My research group also works on the design and development of distributed file-system and secure storage in distributed system. Research contributions include: 
 1. We have proposed an adaptive metadata management strategy, which has more flexibility and better response time than well-known dynamic sub-tree partitioning method in large-scale file systems. 
 2. In distributed shared storage systems, it is difficult for users to secure data storage or data sharing of their own files due to lack of control over underlying storage. To solve this issue, we have designed and implemented a stackable secure storage, called  Corslet , which runs directly on deployed storage systems without any modification.  Corslet  brings end-to-end confidentiality and integrity as well as efficient access control for user data.
