 Research Status 
 I received the Ph.D. degree from Department of Computer Science   Technology at Tsinghua University in 2000 and have been working here since I finished my research work as a post-doctor at Department of Electronic Engineering of Tsinghua University in 2001. My research areas are Semantic Web and Semantic Web Services, and text and social network mining. Currently, my research focuses on studying key technologies in semantic content management, and applying them in the domains of news, social networks, and web services. I have published about 90 papers in international journals and conferences including SIGIR, SIGMOD, SIGKDD, ISWC, CIKM, JoDS, JoWS etc. 
 1. Ontology-based semantic content management. In semantic content management, ontology matching and semantic annotation are our main research topics. In ontology matching, we proposed a Bayes decision-based ontology matching framework, and further proposed a dynamic ontology matching framework to solve the aggregation problem of different matching methods for difference matching tasks. Our related work has been published in many papers such as JoWS, TKDE, and SIGMOD, and the citation number of our JoWS paper by Google Scholar is 73. In semantic annotation, we have developed three models to annotate different kinds of resources with different characteristics, including rule-based model named iASA, an SVM classification-based method, and a CRFs-based model. These models have been applied in different annotation tasks such as research profiling, stock annual report extraction, and conference annotation. The above work is funded by NSFC and National 973 Basic Research Program. 
 2. News and Social Network Mining. In news mining, we proposed index tree and name entity-based topic detection and tracking method, and further proposed a topic-based news exploration framework. This research is published in SIGIR 2007 and demoed in SIGKDD 2009. In social network mining, we proposed an expertise-oriented social network search framework, which has been used in a practical academic social network mining system-Arnetminer. We have also studied the problems of expert finding, conference mining, and research interest finding. 
 3. XML application in news domain. I am the fourth author of China Standard  Chinese News Markup Language (CNML)  (GB/T20092-2006), and the PI for the project named CNML Management System. This software has been applied in many business systems of Xinhua News Agency, such as text, image and multimedia editing systems. We have won the second prize of Wang Xuan Award for Science and Technology Achievement in News Domain.
