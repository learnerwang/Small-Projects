 Research Status 
 Since 1999, I have been working on algorithms and software development of interconnect parasitic extraction for VLSI circuits. From 2004 to 2007, I worked on the extraction of substrate coupling parameters for the mixed-signal circuits and impedance extraction. From 2005 to 2008, I visited University of California at San Diego (UCSD) several times and collaborated with Prof. C-K Cheng on the research of interconnect analysis and circuit simulation. My major contributions are as follows. 
1. Proposed several fast algorithms for 3-D capacitance extraction based on direct boundary element method. I have directed or co-directed the development of two prototypes-QBEM and HBBEM (with Prof. Zeyi Wang). They have both been  acquire d by ICScape Inc. and JEDAT Inc., and become a part of their commercial tools for designing VLSI circuits and LCD. The core algorithm in HBBEM, adopted by IBM Watson Research Center, evolved to be CSurf-a premier 3-D capacitance solver of IBM. 
2. Proposed several algorithms of capacitance and resistance extraction, which addresses some issues of nanometer technologies, such as floating dummy fill, multi-via connection, and intra-die random variation. My research in this area was published in IEEE Trans. Computer-Aided Design, IEICE Trans. Electronics, DATE 2008, and DAC 2009. They have drawn attentions from both research and industrial community. 
3. Proposed fast and versatile extraction algorithms for both substrate resistances and frequency-dependent parameters, respectively, taking substrate coupling effect in mixed-signal and RF chips into consideration. My research in this area was published in IEEE Trans. Computer-Aided Design. 
4. Proposed an accurate eye-diagram prediction algorithm based on the linear system's step response. In collaboration with UCSD researchers, I proposed an optimized flow of passive equalizer for off-chip interconnect design, and a simulation algorithm based on frequency-domain analysis. My research in this area was published in IEEE Trans. Computer-Aided Design, IEICE Trans. Electronics, DAC 2008, and ICCAD 2008.  
I am actively involved in academic activities both domestically and internationally, and have been frequently invited to be the TPC member and editor of conferences and journals in the above areas.
