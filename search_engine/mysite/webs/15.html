 Research Status 
 The research fields of my group include massive network storage systems, their key technologies, and storage security and reliability. Our main research contributions are as follows: 
 In the aspect of massive network storage systems, we have proposed scalable massive network storage architecture and its implementation method, and have also developed TH-MSNS (Tsinghua Mass Storage Network System), a SAN-based network storage system. In the development of this system, we found data chunks' characteristics of reordering window and proposed an efficient approach to scaling round-robin striped volumes. Besides, we have also proposed an online cache method to solve the unstable performance problem due to variable workloads in storage systems. At present, there are nearly 100 sets of TH-MSNS applied in many fields, including audit, public security, oil field, telecom, and education. 
 In the aspect of storage reliability, our contributions include: 1) proving the equivalence between B-Code constructions and perfect one-factorizations in graph theory, and making systematic studies on cyclic lowest-density MDS array codes using starters in group theory; 2) proposing a family of erasure codes, named  GRID Codes , which are implemented based on XOR operations and can tolerate up to 15 disk failures while maintaining good storage efficiency; 3) proposing an efficient method using erasure codes' error detection ability, rather than metadata, to solve the problem of silent data corruptions in large-scale erasure-coded storage systems; and 4) proposing Disk Architecture with Composite Operation (DACO), which avoids traditional  read-modify-write  operations in parity update and thus alleviates the small-write performance problem in large-scale erasure-coded storage systems.
