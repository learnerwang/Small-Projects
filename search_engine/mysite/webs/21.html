 Research Status 
 In recent years, I have mainly engaged in the research and teaching of computer network architecture and new generation network. In the past five years, I have published 69 papers, among which 17 papers are indexed by SCI and 56 papers indexed by EI. 12 patents have been filed. My main research achievements are as follows: 
 1.  Fundamental Research of New Generation Network Architecture . Multiple dimensional scalable optimized analysis model of new generation network architecture is proposed to analyze the scalability issue of Internet performance, scale and service, providing feasible ideas and methods for analyzing and evaluating next-generation network architecture. The optimal theory based on network utility studies multi-path traffic management of the Internet and the optimal traffic engineering, and proposes a logarithm barrier-based multipath traffic management method with theoretical optimization and convergence guarantee. A resource-oriented network utility optimization traffic engineering model is proposed based on proportional load balancing and other new concepts, acquiring the new result that, the optimal routing in proportional load balancing is the minimal routing of M/M/1 queuing delay. In the validation mechanism of inter-domain IPv6 real source addressing and the buildup of test-bed, a BGP-scalable, routing selection notification-based  validation mechanism is proposed to analyze the effectiveness of source address filtering. Test bed is built in Tsinghua University and has been deployed in CERNET2.  The collaboratively completed RFC 5210 won the Annual China University-Wide Top-Ten Science and Technology Achievements in 2008. 
 2.  Software Platform and Development Environment of Scalable and Reconfigurable High-Performance Routers . Integrated router software platform and development environment with independent intellectual properties and scalable and reconfigurable functionalities are designed, which have real-time multi-task cores and scalable and secure software architecture, and support dynamic scalability of function models and new-generation integrated router hardware platform. IPv6 core routers based on this result have won the 2nd-class Prize of National Science and Technology Progress Award in 2005 and the 1st-class Prize of CCF Wang Xuan Award in 2006. IPv6 core routers have been applied in network carriers such as CERNET2, China Telecom, China Mobile and so on, gaining huge economic and social impact. Based on this software platform, a CNGI project- Routers with IPv6 network Application Analysis and Filtering Functions -is completed, and a national 863 program- Development Environment for Reconfigurable Router Switching -is being undertaken. 
 3.  Overlay Network Application Environment and Traffic Modeling, Detection and Management of P2P Networks . The supporting environment of Internet overlay applications is studied based on service carrier networks. Mathematic models are set up for overlay network resource management and performance evaluation. Negative effects on network performance due to the selfness of users in structureless overlay networks are analyzed based on game theory, and solutions are given based on mechanism design theory. An overlay management framework is built based on end-to-end control theory. A P2P traffic distribution model and a P2P traffic recognition method based on traffic behavior recognition are proposed. On this basis, a P2P traffic optimization framework is proposed to study the P2P traffic optimization method based on cache and request redirection. A new caching replacement algorithm for P2P streaming applications is proposed. Based on the above results, a high-efficient, script description-supportive P2P traffic recognition and management system is invented.
