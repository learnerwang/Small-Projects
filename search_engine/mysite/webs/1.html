 Research Status 
 My research focuses on combinatorial optimization algorithms and large-scale numerical computing analysis in VLSI design automation. Since 1986, I have been working on the interconnect analysis and optimization, P/G network design, low-power physical design, and DFM driven layout optimization. At present, our group is developing systems and tools to implement and optimize the physical design of larger-scale integrated circuits. 
 In the area of P/G network IR-drop noise analysis and Decap optimization, I have proposed several approaches to simulating and optimizing P/G networks. These GPU-based approaches use parallel computing methods to achieve fast and accurate simulation results for large-scale P/G networks. Related papers are published in international conferences such as ICCAD, DAC and ISPD, one of which has been nominated as DAC2009 Best Paper. 
 In the area of low-power physical designs, I have proposed some novel power/clock gating optimization processes/algorithms, which take trade-offs between timing delay and power in consideration to promote fast convergence of high performance and low power complex designs. Related papers are published in international conference ISPD and IEEE Trans. on VLSI. 
 In the area of manufacturing (DFM) driven algorithm design, my research group has, in collaboration with Synopsys Inc., proposed an efficient process-hotspot detection algorithm using range pattern matching. Related papers are published in international conference ICCAD (Best Paper Nominee) and IEEE Trans. on VLSI.
