 Education background 
 Bachelor of Computer Science   Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 1998; 
Master of Computer Science   Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 2000; 
Ph.D. in Computer Science   Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 2008. 
 Areas of Research Interests/ Research Projects 
 Computer Networks, Distributed Information Systems 
 China Next Generation Internet (CNGI) Project: National College and University Recruitment System on IPv6 Network (2009-2010); 
Key Project of Ministry of Education: Parallel Application Submission Subsystem of National College and University Enrolling System (2009-2010); 
Key Project of Ministry of Education: Security Subsystem of National College and University Enrolling System (2007-2008); 
National Natural Science Foundation of China: Research on Basic Theories of Resource Organization and Management in a Network Computing Environment (2004-2007); 
Key Project of Ministry of Education: Online Admission Management System for National College and University Enrollment (2004-2007); 
Key Project of Ministry of Education: Online Recruitment System for National College and University Enrollment (2000-2002). 
 Research Status 
 My research group addresses both theoretical and practical aspects of computer networks and distributed information systems. Basic architectures and construction methods of Internet based on loosely coupled information service grids were studied. Some novel resource discovery, location and scheduling mechanisms were presented. Furthermore, various models and algorithms were designed and evaluated. Additionally, my research group has developed several information systems to support National College and University Recruitment. The admission management subsystem and online recruitment subsystem in particular are large-scale distributed information systems, which have changed the workflow of admission management and enrollment, promoted its informationization process, and guaranteed an open and fair atmosphere of the recruitment procedure. These systems have become the most important and successful demonstration applications on CERNET (China Education and Research Network) and brought large amounts of economic and social benefits.
