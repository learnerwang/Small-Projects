 Research Status 
 My research interests include Security, Privacy, and Applied Cryptography with current focuses on Security and Privacy in Cloud Computing, Wireless Ad Hoc Mesh, Sensor Network Security, Lower-layer Attack and Defense Mechanisms for Wireless Networks, Security and Privacy in Smart Grid, and Access Control with Attribute-based Cryptographic Techniques. In particular, my recent and current research efforts focus on two fronts of research topics. Firstly, I am interested in security and privacy issues in application-layer overlay networks, towards Delay/Disruption-tolerant, self-healing networking. Particularly, I am interested in providing graceful security and privacy schemes for network coding in multicast sessions. Secondly, I'm interested in security/privacy issues of clouding computing, 3GPP, multi-hop wireless networks, including mobile ad-hoc and sensor networks, particularly theoretical studies and application-layer solutions.
