 Research Status 
 My research focuses on modeling and performance evaluation of computer networks and other computer systems. The methodology is based on Petri Nets and stochastic models. The purpose of performance evaluation is mainly threefold: selection, improvement and design. The bottleneck of system performance can be traced out through evaluation and thereby improved to guarantee the QoS. My interests also include stochastic modeling of dependability, and frameworks and mechanisms of trustworthy networks. My group quantifies the dependability and survivability of systems, and improves them using fault tolerance mechanisms. In addition, I am also interested in the research of parallel and distributed computing involved with computer networks. The focal point of my research is how to enhance QoS of information systems. 
 On the basis of conventional Petri Nets, I propose a kind of high-level stochastic Petri Nets which uses simplified stochastic models to evaluate the performance of homogeneous systems. This method reduces state spaces of original system models so as to simplify computation complexities. Besides, I combine the idea of Petri Nets and game theory to propose a new methodology-Game Nets. Given its definition and properties, it can be used to analyze the attack and defense activities in networks. I also propose the concept of trustworthy networks, which has become the hotspot of current network studies. We use probability theory and stochastic process to quantify the metrics of dependability. In addition, some dependable network frameworks and mechanisms have been researched. 
 As high-level stochastic Petri Net has become the simplified models of more and more complex control systems, it has effectively directed the management and execution of computer systems. Performance evaluation based on high level stochastic Petri Nets are widely accepted by academia. Accordingly, my group has developed simulation tools of High level Petri Nets and Fluid Petri Nets.
