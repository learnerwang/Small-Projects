 Research Status 
 My research group addresses fundamental problems of 3D video representation, interaction, codec and transmission, carrying the objective of providing interactive immersive multimedia application in future Internet. 
We built a statistical link model for application- layer multicast and discovered that the congestion of the neighboring link layer has Markov properties. By studying the logs of practical VoD broadcasting systems and P2P live broadcasting systems, my group established a model for users' online time and their prospective activities during that time. We also theoretically analyzed the bandwidth utilization optimality of pull-based p2p streaming systems, and proposed a push-pull model for p2p streaming data scheduling, which reduced the delay and control overhead, while maintaining optimal bandwidth utilization. 
We proposed a multi-view video coding scheme, which supports random accesses among views. Compared with traditional methods, our scheme improves the coding efficiency up to 2-3 db, while reducing the delay of view switching. Based on the theory of directed acyclic graph, my group designed a spatial-temporal data paralleling algorithm for multi-view video coding over multi-core processor architecture, which achieves an approximate linear speed-up. Also, an accurate estimation model for the multi-core media processing task scheduling is established by abstracting the critical properties of multimedia applications and multi-core processors. Utilizing the correlation of data between different views, I proposed a collaborative hybrid overlay network structure for large-scale multi-view video streaming of 3DTV systems.
