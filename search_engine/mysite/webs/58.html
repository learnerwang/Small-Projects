 Education background 
 Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China, 1984; 
Master of Mechanics, Beijing University of Aeronautics   Astronautics, Beijing, China, 1987. 
 Areas of Research Interests/ Research Projects 
 Embedded Systems 
Automotive Electronics, Operating Systems for Vehicles 
 National Natural Science Foundation of China: Key Technologies and Integration Platform of Artificial Cognition Technology for Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles (2009-2012); 
National 863 High-Tech Program: Remote Maintenance and Supervision of Engineering Machineries (2008-2010). 
 Research Status 
 My research group has engaged in hardware design and software development of embedded systems and automotive electronics for ten years. I have been in charge of or participated in over 10 projects, including National 863 High-Tech Program, the Ninth Five-Year Plan, International Cooperation with General Motors etc.  
Since 2002, my research group has been in charge of two 863 programs- Powertrain Control System for Electric Bus  and  Powertrain Control Software and Hardware Platform for Fuel-cell Bus . A real-time on-vehicle operating system named  OSEKLinux  was designed based on OSEK (open system and the corresponding interfaces for automotive electronics) specification and Linux operating system to provide a free, open and practical software development platform for automotive electronics. We used the MPC500 family microcontroller to develop a rapid-control prototype system, which has been deployed to some electric vehicles. I own 4 authorized patents and 2 registered software copyrights.
