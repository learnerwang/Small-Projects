 Research Status 
 I began research and teaching in the field of computer networks in1977.I have presided over 20 major national research and engineering projects related to computer network. 
 1. I presided over the CERNET demonstration project in 1994, when China still did not have large-scale Internet design and construction experiences. Through hard working and collaborative research with other 10 universities, we successfully built the China Education and Research Network (CERNET) demonstration project. CERNET is an ambitious project of our country for the twenty-first century. Being an advanced computer network that covers the whole country, its technology has reached international advanced level of the 90s. It was awarded second-class National Awards for Progress in Science and Technology in 1997. In this project, I put forward a large-scale Internet architecture design scheme which contains the core ideas of connectionless packet switching, flow-based sub-regional routing and accounting, a large-scale Internet operation and management system based on the technologies of running flow active network element and data link dynamic acquisition, and a security system based on cycle-based security view. I have been responsible for the technical work of CERNET for a long period and presided over the completion of six major national projects. CERNET now has become the world's largest national academic network, which played an important role in accelerating the technological progress of China's Internet and promoting the use and training of it. 
 2. I have long been engaged in the research of computer network routing and switching technologies. I presided over the development of IPv6 core router. The success of the IPv6 core router is a major breakthrough of key network technologies, and it promoted the localization process of key network equipment development in China. In the 1980s, in the severe situation of the restrictions on Chinese imports of foreign network equipment, I have successful presided over the developments of many key network equipment such as X.25 packet switching network and routing device, advanced network processor and high-performance security router, and promoted the use of these equipment in real networks. Core router is the heart of the Internet. It includes complicated technologies and only the United States, Japan and other technologically advanced countries master its core technology at that time. China's Internet formerly relied on foreign routers, which brought a significant risk to national security. In 2004, I worked with my colleagues and finished the development of IPv6 Core Router with independent intellectual properties. It is the first internal router that passed the IPv6 Core Router Test Specification (Draft) test by Ministry of Information Industry. Its overall technology has reached international advanced and domestic leading level, and it has four important innovations including the scalable router operating system BWOS. Its mixed IPv6/IPv4 dual-stack routing table method and new methods for establishing IPv4overIPv6 tunnel are in the leading positions in the world. This research result was awarded the second-class National Awards for Progress in Science and Technology in 2005. It gained five national invention patents, and has been widely used in network projects such as CNGI (China Next Generation Internet) program. 
 3. I have long been engaged in the research of Internet architecture and protocol theory, and key technologies of Internet, and have made some innovative research results. In the 1980s, I proposed the theory of protocol conformance test systems based on expanded labeled transition system, developed a TCP/IP protocol conformance test system to effectively test the Internet protocols. In 2003, I was hired as the chief scientist of the National 973 Project  Theoretical Study on a New Generation Internet , and led project team to work hard and achieve a number of innovative research results, such as a new Internet architecture which has multi-dimension scalabilities in aspects of scale, function, performance, security and service. I put forward the roadmap of  Constructing the Large-scale Pure IPv6 Internet Backbone , which aims to address the technical problems of large-scale IPv6 backbone such as network topology and routing design, addressing and naming planning, network measurement and management. I also put forward an  IPv4overIPv6 Transition  theory, which used inexplicit tunneling technology to solve the technical problems such as IPv4 and IPv6 compatibility, transmission mapping, manageability, scalability, security and auto-configuration. I proposed an  Authentic IPv6 Source Address Architecture  which has become one of the important technical foundations of trusted next generation Internet. The above results have applied for 11 Chinese patents (3 authorized), promoted the Internet standards organization IETF to set up Softwire and SAVI working groups, and submitted 10 IETF draft standards and 1 CCSA standard. I am the first author of RFC 5210, RFC 5565 and RFC 5747. 
 4. I presided over the major national projects CNGI-CERNET2/6IX, which improved China's next generation Internet technologies to the international competitive position. I started next generation Internet research in 1998 and presided over the NSFCNET project in 2000, which achieved 10Gbps high-speed IPv6 testbed for the first time in China using IP/DWDM technology, and are able to connect to the international Next Generation Internet. In 2003, I presided over the  China Next Generation Internet core network CNGI-CERNET2/6IX  project by uniting 25 universities. This project is currently the world's largest pure IPv6 Internet backbone. It designed and constructed a large-scale next generation Internet backbone mainly based on domestic equipments, which has a major impact both domestically and internationally. It has a number of major innovations which includes: building large-scale pure IPv6 Internet backbone, authentic IPv6 source address architecture, and IPv4overIPv6 transitional technology. They are all international initiatives and reached world leading level. This project strongly promoted China's core network device industrialization and made an important contribution to China's participation in international Next Generation Internet test bed. In this project, I proposed a technology roadmap for  building a large-scale pure IPv6 Internet backbone , a major strategy of  mainly using domestic core IPv6 routers to construct large-scale backbone , and key technologies of  authentic IPv6 source address architecture  and  IPv4overIPv6 transitional theory . This project has major impacts on international academic community. The results were awarded Second National Awards for Progress in Science and Technology in 2007 and rated as  Top Ten Scientific and Technological Progress of China  in 2004 and 2006. 
 5. I have long been active in Internet area. I was the APAN Vice-Chairman since 1999 and was elected as Chairman of APAN in 2008. I was awarded as China's Top Ten Scientific and Technological Excellence by IEEE Spectrum in 2005 and gained  IPv6 Pioneer Award  by IPv6 Forum in 2007. I have chaired IEEE, ICNP, ICDCS and other international conferences.
