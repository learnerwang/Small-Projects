 Research Status 
 I have gained several years' practical experiences of seismic  exploration and data processing in petroleum industry during my Ph.D. study. However,  my fascination about computer software grew in connection with those doctorate topics,  and I went on to pursue research work in computer science and technology after  graduation. 
  My previous knowledge and experiences in engineering mechanics,  such as inverse problem theory, numerical methods, and optimization algorithms,  have greatly contributed to my current research on software optimization and  improvement, software development process, and hardware/software co-design  process evaluation and improvement. 
  My general research interests is the method, design and implementation  of trustworthy embedded systems.
