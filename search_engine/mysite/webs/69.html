 Research Status 
 My research group has addressed fundamental problems of service computing, designed efficient algorithms for automatic service composition, and developed various service composition systems. As service-oriented computing (SOC) becomes the new computing paradigm of the Internet, it is a big necessity to automatically combine some web services in a certain way to satisfy specific requirements. My research achieved remarkable improvement on efficiency of automatic service composition. 
 My research group observes the data correlations between services' outputs and inputs. In existing works, data correlations are usually expressed in an implicit and automatic way by reasoning on data models or ontology models used in service definitions. My group proposes to express data correlations by explicit declarations. Referring to the fundamental idea of hyperlinks, the Service Data Link model (SDL) is proposed to explicitly declare data correlations among services. Furthermore, my group combines the expressive power of the SDL model with the Service Dependency Graph model (SDG), and present SDG+, an extended version of SDG, which introduces three extensions: 1) attribute quantifier, 2) attribute transform, and 3) explicit dependency. Taking advantage of explicit dependency, a major extension of SDG+, my group developed a composition algorithm for IEEE CEC Web Service Challenge 2007, which significantly improved the performance in dealing with datasets that contain complex inheritances among message types. The system designed based on this algorithm won the championship of Performance Evaluation in the competition. 
 In our research of automatic composition problem of QoS-aware and non-predefined workflow, a theoretical data-driven and QoS-optimized service composition model is proposed. In order to acquire composition solutions with optimal end-to-end QoS, my group utilize the semantic information among data types to realize semantic matching in service composition, and have proposed two composition algorithms. One is based on iterative generation, which iteratively searches services and updates the optimal QoS values; the other is based on greedy procedure which always selects the services with optimal accumulated QoS values. The experiment results show that the two algorithms are able to solve the problem correctly and satisfy the efficiency requirement of runtime systems. The system designed based on these two algorithms won the first place team and first runner-up team of Performance Evaluation in IEEE CEC Web Service Challenge 2008 and 2009.
