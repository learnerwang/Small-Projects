 Education background 
 Bachelor of Computer Science, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, 2002; 
 Ph.D. in Computer Science   Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 2007. 
 Areas of Research Interests/ Research Projects 
 VLSI Physical Design, Design-Manufacturing Interface. 
 National  He Gao Ji  Major Project: Development of Advanced EDA Platforms (2008-2010). 
 Research Status 
 After graduation in 2007, I worked with Prof. Andrew B. Kahng as a postdoctoral scholar in Department of Computer Science and Engineering, UC San Diego. In my postdoctoral research, I focused on the areas of design for manufacturing, delay and leakage optimization, etc. Collaboratively, we published several papers, including one DAC 2008 paper and one ICCAD 2008 paper (Best Paper Nomination). We also filed a patent in UCSD. Besides, two journal papers have been accepted by  IEEE Trans. on CAD of Integrated Circuits and Systems . My current research group focuses on the area of VLSI physical design, including topics of floor-planning, placement, routing, clock tree synthesis and routing, timing analysis and optimization, etc. 
 Honors And Awards 
 ICCAD 2006, 2008: Best Paper Nomination (2006, 2008); 
 CCF (China Computer Federation) Outstanding Ph.D. Thesis Nomination (2007); 
 Tsinghua University Outstanding Ph.D. Thesis Award, Second Class (2007).
