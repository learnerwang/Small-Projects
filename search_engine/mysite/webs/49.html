 Research Status 
 Representation and reasoning of spatial knowledge are important in many application areas such as geographic information systems, geo-location services, robotics, and computer vision. I (with coauthors) have systematically investigated a comprehensive topological approach, making significant contributions in spatial relation modeling and constraint solving. A major part of these contributions were built on Region Connection Calculus (RCC), which is the most influential qualitative spatial reasoning paradigm. 
1.  The Formal Spatial Theory GRCC . We established a formal theory-Generalized Region Connection Calculus (GRCC), which accommodates discrete as well as continuous spatial models. The original RCC theory has only continuous models, but discrete models are evidently important in the implementation of spatial information systems. We solved this conflict and established the connection between continuous and discrete models. Based on GRCC, we established a framework for the hierarchical representation of topological information. 
2.  Composition-based Reasoning Technique . This is a predominant technique used in qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning. We proved that the composition specified in the RCC8 composition table cannot be interpreted extensionally in any RCC model, and that Egenhofer's 9-Intersection Model (1991) is a maximal extension model for the RCC8 composition table. This implies that whether a relation model is closed under composition is independent of the completeness of the composition-based reasoning. This refutes a conjecture made by Bennett, Isli, and Cohn (1997). 
3.  Expressive Topological Relation Models . Applying the 9-Intersection Method to two complex plane regions, we obtained a set of 38 basic topological relations among plane regions. By introducing the complements of simple regions, we proposed the complemented Egenhofer model and proved that this model provides a representation for the RCC11 algebra of Duentsch (2005). To cope with imprecise or vague topological information, we proposed a fuzzy set theoretic approach to topological relations. 
4.  Spatial Constraint Solving Algorithms .We solved several important constraint satisfaction problems in spatial reasoning. For RCC8 algebra, we devised a cubic realization algorithm, and proved that a subclass T is tractable if its closure in RCC8 is tractable. This removes any doubts about the complexity results of Renz and Nebel (1999). The key notion of one-shot extension we introduced was identified later as a sufficient condition for a relation algebra being representable. Skiadopoulos and Koubarakis listed the satisfaction problem of the Cardinal Direction Calculus as an open problem in their paper published in Artificial Intelligence (2005). We completely solved this problem by devising the first correct polynomial realization algorithm. Hybrid spatial constraints are often required in practical applications. We investigated the combination of topological and directional constraints in detail. For Rectangle Algebra (RA), we identified interesting tractable subclasses of hybrid RCC8 and RA constraints. For CDC, we proved that the combination problem is NP-Complete even for basic constraints. 
The above results were mainly published on Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ, 5 papers) and international conferences IJCAI, AAAI, and ECAI.
