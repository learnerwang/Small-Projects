 Research Status 
 My research addresses the methods and techniques of software testing for complex systems and for new computing paradigm in the Internet era. Starting from my Ph.D. study, I worked on the end-to-end integration testing methodology for large-scale systems of interconnected components. We proposed a scenario-based approach (called thin-thread in the DoD project) for test requirements modeling, hierarchical test design, and regression testing. After that, I joined Tsinghua University and got involved in the preparation and operation of the information systems of the Olympic Games, as a technique expert. I led a research project on integration testing which focused on the perspectives of process management and project supervision. 
 In the recent five years, my research interest is on the quality issues of service-oriented architecture (SOA) and Software as a Service (SaaS). As new software paradigms, SOA and SaaS shift the focus of software development from coding to composition by reusing services of large granularities that are accessible through standard protocols. I proposed a framework of runtime collaborative testing and researched on the issues including testing architecture, ontology-based test generation, test ontology model, agent-based collaborative testing, runtime monitoring and policy enforcement, and adaptive testing. The objective is to enforce continuous quality mechanism during the lifecycle of dynamic service registration, discovery, composition and evolution. 
 In addition, I researched on model-based testing automation systems and techniques, and proposed a SyncTest framework which aims to synchronize the changes of code, program model and test scripts. This research investigates changes from two levels: code level and requirements level, and introduces modeling and test generation techniques following the model-driven architecture. 
 Until now, I have published over 60 papers in international and domestic journals and conferences, a book  Service-Oriented Software Engineering  written in Chinese. I have involved in many international conferences as program committee chair or member, including SOSE, SCC, COMPSAC, QSIC, SEKE, etc. I'm the associate editor of IJSEKE and serve as reviewer to many international and domestic journals.
