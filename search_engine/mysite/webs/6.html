 Research Status 
 My research group addresses fundamental problems in all aspects of intelligent process of visual media. The visual media data that my group studied includes images, videos and 3D digital geometry. Here intelligent processing means that we explore and extract the inherent patterns in the visual media, characterize them using appropriate geometric structures (possibly after applying some non-linear feature transformations and dimension reductions), and use these geometric structures to design efficient algorithms that behave like assigning machine intelligence to the computer. As a typical example, my research work  Sketch2Photo: Internet Image Montage  has been voted as Top 10 Most Promising Digital Initiatives in 2010 by Netexplorateurs, France ( http://www.netexplorateur.org/ q=en/top-10 ). The research work of my group has been published on ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG), International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), Computer-Aided Geometric Design (CAGD), Computer Aided Design (CAD) and The Visual Computer (TVC). These papers have been cited by more than 1200 times. 
 Another direction of my research is dedicated security-focused operating system and middleware techniques. For reasons of disk economy and efficiency, reducing disk energy consumption and improving disk performance in high-performance computer systems are increasingly pressing issues. To achieve these goals, we define the concept of ISRA (Immediate Successor Relationship Amount) to represent the successor relationship of data blocks, and propose an ISRA-based grouping algorithm for disk reorganization, based on an undirected graph. This work was published in IEEE Transactions on Computers.
