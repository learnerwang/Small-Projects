 Education background 
 Bachelor of Computer Science, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, 1999; 
 Ph.D. in Computer Science   Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 2004. 
 Areas of Research Interests/ Research Projects 
 Computer-Aided Design of VLSI Circuits and Systems 
 Design and Analysis of Algorithms 
 National Natural Science Foundation of China: Research on Floorplanning Algorithms based on Timing Analysis and Optimization (2007-2009). 
 Research Status 
 My research focuses on designing fundamental algorithms in the area of VLSI design automation. I develop systems and tools to optimize the physical layout and logical design of integrated circuits (ICs). I am also working on the algorithms for combinatorial optimization and stochastic optimization. As a research associate, I visited Prof. Jason Cong's group in UCLA in 2005. During one year's stay in UCLA, I developed  3D MEVA , an evaluation model for micro-architecture of 3D ICs. Recently, I've been leading several projects on 3D ICs. Related papers are published on top conferences such as ICCAD, DAC, ASPDAC, etc. 
 In recent years, I have proposed several approaches to optimizing the physical design process of 2D and 3D ICs, which integrate various constraints such as timing, layout and power. To achieve efficient optimization of multiple objectives with complex constraints, an analytical optimization approach simulating the appealing and repelling force model is proposed for 3D ICs' packing process. In addition, I also proposed a novel incremental optimization process and its associated algorithms, which are helpful to the fast convergence of the complex designs. 
 Most of my work aims at optimizing the design process of IC layout to improve its performance, reliability and cost efficiency. This topic lies between CS and EE, and I have been collaborating with several professors in both areas, investigating ways to improve the electronic design ability, as well as the algorithms in computer science.
