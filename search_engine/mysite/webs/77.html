 Education background 
 Bachelor of Computer Science   Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 2001; 
 Master of Computer Science   Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 2004; 
 Ph.D. in Computer Science   Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 2007. 
 Areas of Research Interests/ Research Projects 
 Computer Graphics 
 National Natural Science Foundation of China: Video Cartoonizing based on Structure Analysis (2009-2012). 
 Research Status 
 My research area is computer graphics. Currentl0y, I am focusing on non-photorealistic rendering, aiming to generate artistic images or videos using computers. In this direction, I have proposed a trapped-ball method for vectorizing cartoon animations, which can be used in the reuse of cartoon figures and materials. I have also proposed a video synthesis method for the generation of running water animation in Chinese painting style, which can transfer the captured running water video into the Chinese painting style.
