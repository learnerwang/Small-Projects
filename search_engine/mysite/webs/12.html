 Research Status 
 I am generally interested in the research areas of intelligent information processing, information retrieval, and Web data mining. Among them, I have been recently focusing on improving search performance with the help of semantic mining of user behaviors. 
 Due to the giant volume of Web information and limitations of current intelligent technologies, semantic analysis of on-line data faces lots of challenges. While billions of users are surfing the Web each day by means of direct typing of domain name, hyperlink on existing Web pages, or search engines, it is believed that their behaviors contain certain semantic information, which can be further utilized to help us better understand the semantic meanings of online data. Therefore, we work on this kind of information with the aim of improving the performance of Web search engines. 
 Our recent projects span over Web page quality estimation, Web spam page and illegal resource identification, search performance evaluation, on-line advertising performance evaluation, and search engine query recommendation. We have published a dozen of high-quality papers at important journals and conferences such as JASIST, WWW, CIKM, and WSDM.  8 Chinese patents were filed and 3 of them have been authorized.  Algorithms and systems developed in these projects have been successfully adopted by Sogou.com, one of the most popular search engines in China. 
 Demos of our research projects can be found at SearchE Search Engine Performance Evaluation System ( http://searche.thuir.cn/ ), and Sogou.com Laboratory ( http://www.sogou.com/labs ).
