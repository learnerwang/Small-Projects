 Research Status 
 1.  Topology in Process Algebras . Process algebras are among the most successful models of concurrent systems. One of the central notions of process algebras is bisimulation. However, it cannot be used to describe the approximate behaviour of concurrent systems. I proposed a new theory of topology in process algebras in order to describe the approximate correctness and evolution process of concurrent systems. 
 2.  Floyd-Hoare Logic for Quantum Programs . Floyd-Hoare logic is a foundation of axiomatic semantics of classical programs, and it provides effective proof techniques for reasoning about the correctness of classical programs. To offer similar techniques for quantum program verification and to build a logical foundation of programming methodology for quantum computers, I developed a full-fledged Hoare logic for both partial and total correctness of quantum programs. In particular, the (relative) completeness of this logic is proved. The proof techniques are quite different from those for classical programs and need mathematical tools.
