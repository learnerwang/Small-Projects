 Education background 
 Bachelor of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 1991; 
Master of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, 1995. 
 Areas of Research Interests/ Research Projects 
 Artificial Intelligence, Intelligence Application Systems  
Data Mining on Financial Market 
 National 863 High-Tech Program: Integrated Intelligent Aiding System for Safe-Driving based on Real Vision Monitoring (2007-2010); 
National 863 High-Tech Program: Research on Generalized Controllers with Open Structure (2001-2003). 
 Research Status 
 As PI, I have been in charge of multiple projects of 863 High-Tech Program and National Natural Science Foundation. I have published more than 90 papers on international journals and proceedings. Besides, I have received 8 patents authorization and 2 awards from Ministry of Education and City of Beijing, respectively. 
In the area of financial data mining, I researched on real transaction data set using various AI methods and technologies, such as SVM, ESN, ANN and probabilistic models. The aims are two-fold: The first one is mining correlative relationships hidden in large-scale transaction data set to verify these methods in the financial market. The other one is establishing a comprehensive AI solving model for financial problems, which could be a new way for financial market research. 
In the area of intelligent technologies and robot systems, besides robotics intelligent method and models, I also focus on the application research of various kinds of intelligent technologies. Based on the core technologies of moving robot, I make further research on intelligent systems and develop prototyping systems. Typical examples include  a general open controller ,  on-vehicle wireless remote alarm platform based on image processing  ,  soccer robot platform for teaching ,  safe-driving assist system based on driver's vision and road vision detection , etc. 
 Honors And Awards 
 Science and Technology Progress Award by Ministry of Education, Second Class-Controller Development based on DSP (2007).
