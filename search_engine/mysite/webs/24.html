 Areas of Research Interests/ Research Projects 
 Multimedia Information Processing 
 Web Social Network Analysis 
 National Natural Science Foundation of China: Research on Theory and Methods of Web Social Network (2010-2013); 
 National Basic Research Program of China (The 973 Program): Intelligent Processing of Visual Media (2007-2010). 
 Research Status 
 My research group addressed multimedia information analysis in the early years, covering most of the key techniques including video/image compression and codec, media streaming and transmission, distributed multimedia system, content-based image/video retrieval, etc. With the rapid development of social media, we integrate Internet users' behavior with web information, and address the issue of user modeling in social network and the diffusion mechanism of social media in social network. 
 In recent years, we've undertaken a lot of national key research projects from NSFC, National Basic Research Program of China (973), National 863 High-Tech Program, etc. We've published more than 100 research papers. Some of our 30+ alumni have received Excellent Ph.D. Dissertation Award from China Computer Federation (CCF). In addition, several research papers have been awarded or nominated as Best Paper by international transactions and conferences, including IEEE T-CSVT, ICASSP, GlobalComm, etc. Among them, the heuristic scheduling algorithm we proposed for media processing on multi-core processor architecture is awarded as the Best Paper of IEEE T-CSVT in 2009. 
 The research achievements of our group have been widely adopted in various fields and industries. Our P2P streaming media system-GridMdia-was adopted by China Central TV (CCTV) in 2004, which is one of the largest TV networks in the world. 
 Honors And Awards 
 IEEE T-CSVT 2009: Best Paper Award (2009); 
 Science and Technology Progress Award by Ministry of Education, Second Class-Large-Scale E-Learning System (2005).
