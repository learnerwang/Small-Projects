 Research Status 
 I'm generally interested in the research areas of Web search technology and Web user behavior analysis, and have particular focus on improving search performance with the help of user behavior analysis. 
 Current commercial search engines face great challenges in the rapid growth of WWW data and user requests. In order to improve their performance, we believe that the behavior information of search users, so called  wisdom of the crowd , can be utilized. With the support of National Natural Science Foundation of China and  Tsinghua-Sohu  Joint Lab on Web Search Technology, tangible progresses were made in this direction. 
 The aspects of our recent projects cover Web page quality estimation, Web spam page and illegal resource identification, search performance evaluation, on-line advertising performance evaluation, and search engine query recommendation. We have published several high-quality papers in JASIST, WWW, CIKM, WSDM, and some other important journals and conferences. 8 Chinese patents were filed, 3 of which were authorized. Algorithms and systems developed from these projects have been adopted by Sogou.com, one of the most popular search engines in China. 
 Demos of our research projects can be found at SearchE search engine performance evaluation system ( http://searche.thuir.cn/ ) and Sogou.com Laboratory home page ( http://www.sogou.com/labs ).
