 Research Status 
 My research group addresses fundamental problems in social network analysis, data mining, and semantic web. In particular, I focus on modeling social network, tracking users' behaviors, and understanding the evolution of network structures. I have been a visiting scholar at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and Leuven University. I am the principle investigator of several national projects and international joint fundings. 
My current research topics mainly include: 1) Semantic information extraction and integration on the Web. We have proposed various methods for semantic information extraction, which are currently successfully used in several practical applications. 2) Topic-level ranking over heterogeneous networks. In contrast to traditional keyword-based search and object-oriented search, our topic-level search aims at understanding the underlying semantics of documents and queries, and matching them at the topic level. 3) Social action tracking and influence analysis. We have proposed a method to gain insight into the micro-level dynamics of social networks such as how an individual user influences his/her behaviors (actions). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to quantify social influence and analyze the correlation between influence and social actions. 
My research group has developed an academic search system named Arnetminer ( http://arnetminer.org ), in which we aim to provide comprehensive services for academic communities. Currently, the system contains information of over 1 million researchers, 3 million academic papers (including 1 million full papers), and 8 thousand conferences. Services such as expertise search, citation tracing analysis, topical graph search, and topic browser are provided in Arnetminer. The system is in operation on the internet for four years and has received a large amount of accesses from 190 countries. We have applied for 7 patents based on the technologies developed in this system.
