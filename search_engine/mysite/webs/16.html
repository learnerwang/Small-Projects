 Research Status 
 I have been focused on neuro-fuzzy modeling, and control and filtering of nonlinear systems for over ten years. Supported by National Science Foundation of China, National Basic Research Program (973), National 863 High-Tech Program and Advanced Defensive Research Project, series of research achievements have been achieved in stable neuro-fuzzy adaptive control and robust control of nonlinear systems, and filtering and control of Markovian Jump Systems. Significant achievements are listed as follows: 
 1. Stable Neuro-Fuzzy Adaptive Control of Nonlinear Systems. I have proposed a novel design idea of neural network-variable structure control. I have also developed systematic design approaches to the sampled-data adaptive control of (rigid/flexible link) robotic manipulators and a class of nonlinear systems. Those theoretical results have been verified by experiments. Representative paper of this research,  Neural Network-based Adaptive Controller Design of Robotic Manipulators with an Observer , was awarded the first prize of the 18th Choon-Gang academic awards (Korea) in 2003. 
 2. Control and Filtering of Multi-Scale Nonlinear Systems and Markov Jump Systems. 
 A large class of practical plants, including flexible manipulators, flying wing aircrafts, catalytic reduction towers and large flexible space structures, can be described by multiple scale models with small perturbation parameters. I have proposed and proved the existence and sufficiency of approximation of multi-scale nonlinear systems using fuzzy singularly perturbed model (FSPM). I have also indicated the necessary condition of the universal approximator with a given precision. The adaptive and robust control approaches are developed based on both dependent and independent perturbation parameter solutions, which could obtain a significant control precision. Furthermore, effective methods are developed to address the saturation effect and incomplete measurable states in practical systems. I was invited to give a plenary speech in IEEE Intelligent System Design and Applications 2006 on this topic. 
 3. Application Researches. Since I joined Tsinghua University in 2001, I have supervised 20 master and 15 Ph.D students. Our research are related to some of the most important applications of neuro-fuzzy control methods in rigid and flexible-link manipulators, nonlinear systems, internetworked systems, space robots, etc. As of the experimental verification of our theoretical results, we have constructed two flexible-link robot test-beds and a teleoperation system for space on-orbit services. I have published 2 monographs, and filed 8 patent applications (3 authorized).
