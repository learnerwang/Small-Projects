 Research Status 
 Since  2002, with the funding help from National 863 High-Tech  Program and National Natural Science Foundation, my colleagues (Prof. G.Q. Li  from CEODE and Dr. X. Zhang from CAF) and I have been working on applying the  theories and technologies of grid/distributed computing to the Earth  Observation and Navigation domain. Contributions of our research include: 
  1. We proposed architecture for Spatial Information Grid (SIG),  developed a runtime environment of SIG, and created the world's first SIG prototype  in 2003. 
  2. To improve the flexibility of SIG services, we proposed an on-demand  service mechanism, which outperforms traditional mechanism in mass-data processing.  We have also researched on context-centric application automation methods for  easier and quicker SIG application development. Our method automatically  executes the procedures of situation acquirement, processing, and matching, and  then generates a "situational SIG application" without any input from  developers. 
  3. For the purposes of resource sharing and application execution,  a series of SIG middleware have been developed, including SIG Container and SIG  Runtime Environment (SIGRE). We have also designed and developed SIG  Application Engine to provide runtime support and web-based user interfaces. 
  4. To address the issues of managing and distributing remote  sensing data from multiple sources, we have designed and implemented a  SIG-based distribution system, which dispatches remote sensing data from  different sources and of different types and formats, and provides a one-stop on-demand  service for data consumers. 
  5. We have been actively pushing our work to real application  domains. Our first SIG prototype has drawn great attentions from international  practitioners when presented in WGISS 2003. During "5.12" Sichuan earthquake in  2008, our SIG technologies were used to efficiently set up a remote sensing  data distribution system from multiple sources such as USGS and ESA. Besides, our  research on SIG has also been used in areas of forestry resource management,  flood monitoring, and disaster response.
