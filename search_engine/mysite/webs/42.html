 Research Status 
 My research group addresses fundamental problems in VLSI physical design, and has proposed many novel algorithms in this area. Some of them have been successfully embedded in the EDA tools of Japanese or American companies. Based on the achievements of my group, FAIST (Foundation for Advancement of Industry, Science and Technology) of Kitakyushu and Waseda University co-founded an EDA research base for my department in 2006. It is located in Kitakyushu Science and Research Park, and I have been the PI of this cooperation research base since then. 
To solve the problem of floor planning and placement, my group has proposed a novel non-slicing floorplan representation: CBL (Corner Block List). This representation is extended to cover the optimal solution and an ergodic neighborhood transformation is proposed. Based on these, my group also proposed many algorithms to solve various constraints in floorplanning and placement. A novel fixed-outline zero-dead-space floorplanning algorithm is also proposed. It has become the new key basic technology to solve hard problems in physical design of floorplacement. Some of these algorithms have been used in EDA tools. 
My group has also invented two new optimization algorithms. One is the search space smoothing algorithm that can search in the solution space using both global and local smoothing effects. The other is less-flexibility first algorithm. The two algorithms have been used to solve floorplanning, 3D packing and FPGA floorplanning problems.  
Mixed signal SoC physical design and its automation has been virgin soil in EDA area. My group has proposed a novel signal flow method which includes many algorithms to address this challenge. These algorithms include layout constraints automatic extraction, constraints automatic grading, and constraint-driven automatic layout with consideration of symmetry, mismatch, group, signal sensitivity, thermal, etc. The algorithms have been embedded in the EDA tools of Japanese and American companies. 
My group also proposed algorithms on FPGA planning, 2.5D and 3D integration, thermal planning for high density integration, X-and-Y interconnection architecture planning, BUS planning, multi-voltage system optimization, and network-on-chip optimization.
