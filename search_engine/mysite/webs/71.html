 Research Status 
 As the most convenient and effective way of human-computer communication, speech conveys rich information such as meaning, voice biometrics, and emotional state. My research group aims at extracting and identifying such information from speech signals. We have built a universal framework for spontaneous speech understanding, speaker verification/identification, and emotion recognition. I am attempting to explore the underlying mechanisms of speech communication, in particular the structured information of speech.  
My research group also addresses problems in robust speaker recognition for inter- and intra-speaker variations, such as mismatched channels, emotion states and speaking styles. A cohort-based speaker model synthesis method and an emotion attribute projection algorithm have been published. We have also proposed a GMM supervector-based SVM with spectral features for speech emotion recognition, as well as an ANN-based decision fusion method.
