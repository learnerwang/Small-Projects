 Research Status 
 I have been in the area of data management for over 20 years. My research interests include context-aware secure data management towards ambient intelligence, data mining and warehousing, and distributed object-oriented database management systems. As a principal investigator, co-principal investigator, or key project member, I have undertaken 27 national or international projects in mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, Netherlands, and Australia, and published over 130 scientific articles in high-quality international conferences or journals (including ACM TOIS and IEEE TKDE). 
 My research result in secure data management was patented by the Royal Philips in Netherlands due to its innovation and applicability in 2003. My key contribution in the area of data mining is to extend the work on association rule analysis from intra to inter transactional analysis. This is of particular significance when one is looking at forecasting systems. This is also the first work which has done this kind of extension. In the area of data warehouses, I provided explanatory semantics for data warehouses using linguistic representations and fuzzy reasoning. In the area of XML databases, I developed techniques which do transformation of object-oriented systems as well as a conceptual graph approach to the design of XML documents. I once proposed a context-aware data management and service paradigm towards ambient intelligence, which has raised a number of challenging issues in the next-generation mobile intelligent data management field. This work received NWO VIDI Vernieuwingsimpuls (innovational) Outstanding Individual Prize, awarded by the Dutch Organization of Scientific Research, which is the most prestigious award given to outstanding researchers in Netherlands, and I was the first winner from IT field since the establishment of this award in 2000.
