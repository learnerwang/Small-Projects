 Research Status 
 I have been mainly working in the following areas: 
 1. Traffic Control in Computer Networks. Many factors throw obstacles in building a refined dynamic model for transport subsystem in computer networks, such as diversity of traffic statistical distribution, nonlinear coupling imposed by protocols, and time-varying characteristics of network states. Although heuristic algorithms for traffic control can be obtained without the support of system model, they can only work normally under some special environments. Through limited simulations (even experiments), the comprehensive evaluation on performance of these heuristic algorithms is difficult to be conducted, and in-depth understanding and sensible insights are hardly to be obtained. In our work in this area, the network traffic control subsystem will be considered as a nonlinear time-varying delay closed-loop system. Using some proper approximation techniques, such as fluid flow and local linearization, the transport subsystems in computer networks are described by linear differential equations. Combining with these coarse-grained models, the classical analysis approaches in linear and nonlinear control theory, such as describing function, phase plane and Lyapunov function, are used to analyze the stability of typical transport subsystems in computer networks, including TCP/AQM, ATM/FECI, Ethernet/BCN, etc. The explicit criterions of system stability are deduced, which provide some valuable guidelines to parameter settings for stable network operation. Otherwise, these theoretical results also give a reasonable interpretation of some phenomena occurring in transport subsystem. For example, the queue oscillation with identical amplitude should be limit cycle caused by the nonlinear elements embedded into traffic control algorithms. On the other hand, borrowing population ecology evolution theory and utilizing the design techniques in robust control theory, such as internal model control, sliding mode variable structure control and fuzzy control, we develop a series of flow control and congestion control algorithms for heterogeneous computer networks, including ultra-high-speed, large delay, mobile and wireless networks. 
 2. Wireless Sensor Network Architecture and Protocols Design. The coherent architecture and common programming model are crucial for large scale deployment of applications based on wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Following the philosophy of active network, we construct a reference model for WSN architecture, which enables sensor nodes programmability, dynamic loading/unloading of protocols, and the online updating of codes. In addition, the new architecture can improve code reusability and reliability, and can shorten development and deployment cycle of large-scale commercial applications. Finally, it is capable of reducing management cost. On the other hand, exploiting the redundancy of densely deployed sensor nodes and the centripetal pattern (i.e. many-to-one) existing in traffic spatial distribution, and borrowing the concept of potential field in physics, we construct different potential fields referring to different state parameters in networks, and then superpose them into a virtual potential field to drive packets to move directionally in networks. This paradigm can realize the basic function of routing, while can endow additional attributes, including balancing energy consumption, alleviating congestion and assisting data aggregation. Additionally, the other related protocols in WSNs, such as reliable transport, time synchronization and congestion control, are developed.
