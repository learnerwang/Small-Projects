 Internet Architecture 
 P2P Networks, Cloud Computing Networks, Green Networking, Internet of Things 
 Research Status 
 My research group engages in the area of networking, with emphases on Internet architecture design, networking support for emerging applications and service models (e.g. P2P Computing and Cloud Computing), Green Networking, as well as Internet of Things. We take both theoretical and empirical approaches, using prototype systems to validate theoretical results. 
 With commodity switches and servers, I have designed a scalable and cost-effective network architecture for data centers, which is the core of cloud computing. The advantage of this architecture is that, it is highly scalable with constant number of server ports, and provides a practical solution to the construction of large-scale data centers. My group is also addressing other challenging issues on data center networks, such as scalability, performance, fault tolerance, and power consumption. 
 My group has designed a trustworthy P2P network by offering incentives to selfish users. We established a user selfishness model in P2P networks, analyzed the impact of user selfishness on the whole network, and proposed a distributed and trustworthy mechanism to achieve both high performance and robustness in P2P services.
