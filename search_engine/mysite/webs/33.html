 Education background 
 Graduation from Tsinghua University ( Automatic C ontrol) , Beijing, China, 1970. 
  Social service

 Areas of Research Interests/ Research Projects 
 Design Automation for Digital Systems in System, RTL and logic Levels 
 National Natural Science Foundation of China: Research on System Partitioning and Interface Synthesis of Multi-Target and Granularity Self-Adaptive SOC (2002-2005); 
 National Natural Science Foundation of China: Research on TLM F ormal V erification Techniques based on Next- G eneration V erification E ngines (2008-2011); 
 National Basic Research Program of China (The 973 Program): Efficient Design, V erification and T esting Techniques for P rocess C hips (2005-2010). 
 Research Status 
 My research interests include synthesis and verification techniques of all Logic, RTL and system levels. 
 In the 80s, my research group was dealing with technical study and CAD tool development. We have developed a simulation tool for logic and switch levels, which is part of PANDA-a VLSI CAD system used by industry world. This work has won National Award for Science and Technology P rogress. 
 In the 90s , we focused the research of combining l ogic synthesis with l ayout. We have proposed a re-synthesis approach after placement, and used re-wiring technique ( collaborated with Prof. David Yu-liang Wu's group at the Chinese University of Hong Kong) to improve the circuit structure and reduce the wire-length and delay time of critical paths. 
 After 2000, my research group has dealt with synthesis and verification techniques for RTL and system levels. We have built a platform for SOC synthesis, which consists of hardware/software partitioning, architecture synthesis, interface implementation, and behavior synthesis combined with floor-planning. As of RTL verification, we have proposed and implemented a novel hybrid SAT solver named EHSAT. This work was presented in Design Automation Conference 2007-a top conference in this area. 
 Now, we are focusing on the research of description verification with SystemC and TLM (Transaction Level Modeling). We used hybrid SAT and SMT solvers to solve the problems in generating the random stimuli based on constraints.
