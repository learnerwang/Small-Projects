 Research Status 
 In my more than 20 years' research and teaching career, I have been working on computer architecture, telecommunication and computer network, and have accumulated rich experiences. I have published more than 180 papers, most of which in high-quality journals and IEEE conferences or workshops. I have 14 patents, with 5 patents pending. I have been a PI/PD or co-PI of research projects with funding of more than 54 million Chinese Yuan (roughly $7.5 million USD) in total. Many of my innovations have been transferred to industry or commercialized. Some of these technologies have already led to great economic and social impact, including: 
 1.  Network Processor Prototype . I led a research team in developing the first network processor prototype in China from 2002 to 2005 and fabricated the router's line-card by applying this prototype, which passed the strict tests on real equipments. 
 2.  Core Routers . As a principle investigator/chief professor of a key project of national 863 high-tech plan, I led a team in developing a high performance scalable core router with capacity of 128Gbps from 1999 to 2001, which was transferred to BITWAY NETWORKS Inc. China. The router has been commercialized and deployed extensively in China TELECOM, CERNET and China UniCOM. 
 3.  Large-Capacity Broadband/Narrowband Hybrid Switch . As a pluralistic CTO of Weifang Beida Jade Bird Huaguang Technology Inc. from 1996 to 1998, I led a team of 150 people in building a BSP-80 Broadband/Narrowband Hybrid Switch with super-large capacity of carrier-level and putting it into operations in Chinese telecommunication networks. 
 4.  Featured ISDN Switch Fabric . I developed a 64k*64k single-board intelligent ISDN switch in 1997, which was transferred to ZTE (the second largest telecommunication company in China). The built equipment have been sold to Europe and Africa, and greatly contributed to ZTE switches' competitive power in the national market and abroad.
