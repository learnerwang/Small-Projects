 Research Status 
 Currently, my research interests include the modeling and architecture of distributed information systems, and theories and applications of wireless sensor networks. 
 In the area of distributed information systems, I have modeled the distributed information system and proposed a performance analysis based on Petri Net. I have also designed its architecture, and function modules and algorithms for data exchange, data privacy, etc. Based on them, my research group have designed and implemented the National College and University Enrolling System (NACUES) in 2000. NACUES successfully informationized the whole procedure of enrolling, in which the staff of admission offices on their own campuses could get all materials via Internet from respective Provincial Admission Centers. Till the year of 2009, NACUES had been adopted by 30 Provincial Admission Centers and all nation-wide universities and colleges (over 3000) to serve the admission process. Nearly 35 million students have been benefited from this system and enrolled by their universities. 
 In the area of wireless sensor networks, I focus on data transmission protocols and the applications of WSN under water. 
 Honors And Awards 
 Science and Technology Progress Award by Ministry of Education, Second Class-NAtional College and University Enrolling System (NACUES) (2001); 
 Science and Technology Progress Award by Fujian Province, First Class-Information Management System for National Higher Education Exams for Self-Taught Adults (2003); 
 Outstanding Teaching Award by City of Beijing, First Class-Computer Organization (2005).
