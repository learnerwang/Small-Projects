 Research Status 
 My research group focuses on various data mining algorithms and their novel applications, with particular interests in graph data mining, sequence data mining, Web data management and mining, uncertain data mining, and stream data mining. 
 In graph data mining, we investigate the problems such as coherent sub-graph mining, graph generator mining for classification, and structural anonymization of graph data (joint work with IBM). We have proposed the CLAN algorithm for mining closed cliques, the COCAIN and COCAIN* algorithms for mining closed coherent sub-graphs from large dense graph databases, and the FOGGER algorithm for graph generator discovery, which has shown high utility in classification (e.g., image classification and chemical compound classification). 
 We mainly study the problems in sequence data mining topic such as closed sequential pattern mining, gap-constrained sequential pattern mining, sequence generator pattern mining, summarization subsequence mining for clustering, and sequential pattern-based XML document clustering (joint work with IBM). We have proposed a series of efficient algorithms for these problems, including BIDE+, Gap-BIDE, FEAT, XProj, and CONTOUR. We also explore the applications of these algorithms to areas such as classifying consumer product reviews, erroneous sentence detection, and protein data classification. 
 Web data management and mining attracts much attention of my group. In this topic, we mainly focus on the problems such as name disambiguation in digital library and Web people search, community detection in large networks, Web video topic detection, tracking and recommendation, entity and relationship extraction, large-scale dynamic index maintenance, and personalized recommendation systems. We have proposed two graph-based frameworks, GHOST and GRAPE, for name disambiguation in digital library and Web people search respectively, and a parallel community detection algorithm on large networks. 
 My group also works on problems in areas such as stream data mining and uncertain data mining. We have extended several typical frequent itemset mining algorithms for uncertain data (joint work with IBM), and proposed an efficient algorithm to directly mine discriminative patterns for classifying uncertain data and an algorithm for efficient item-set generator discovery over a stream sliding window.
