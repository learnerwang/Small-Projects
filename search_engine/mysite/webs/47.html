 Research Status 
 My research aims at developing and synthesizing various technologies to effectively support human collaboration and problem solving in real world. As an endeavor in this direction, I have achieved the following results: 
 1. Based on grid and Web services, I put forward a cooperative applications development framework named CoFrame. CoFrame is flexible and can support large-scale, inter-organizational and wide-area collaborations that are required by many domains. Based on CoFrame, a learning assessment grid (LAGrid) for China Central Radio   TV University is developed. 
 2. I designed and implemented an intelligent workflow service that balances the control flow between humans and automatic information systems, which not only shows enough respect for human proactiveness, but also reduces the complexity of the workflow system. As a result, the workflow service can well adapt to various changes encountered in the environment. 
 3. I developed a cooperative automaton model, named CoAuto, to analyze cooperative processes. Compared with related work, CoAuto has such advantages as variable analysis granularities, supporting multiple analysis methods, and reusable analysis results.
