 Research Status 
 My research focuses on the research and development of cluster  systems. With my colleagues, I have designed and built several cluster systems,  including one TOP 500 supercomputer. I also attempt to apply high-performance  computing technologies to the fields of computational science and engineering. My  research group has proposed many high-efficiency parallel algorithms for  cluster systems. I have designed a resource management architecture and several  QoS-assurance algorithms for grid computing.  
  The books I wrote,  MPI  Parallel Programming , and  Grid Computing  (as a co-author) ,  have big influence on  China's high-performance computing field.
